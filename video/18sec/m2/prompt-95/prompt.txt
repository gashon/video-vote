A cozy living room with a blue-patterned couch at the center, beige walls, and a wooden coffee table in front. A window with white curtains is visible on the right side, letting in soft sunlight. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is stretched out on the couch, lying on his back with his paws folded on his chest, snoring lightly with his eyes closed. Jerry, the brown mouse, cautiously emerges from behind a cushion on the left side of the couch, glancing up at the sleeping cat with a mischievous expression. The camera slowly zooms in as Jerry tiptoes closer to Tom's head, moving deliberately while looking over his shoulder to ensure the cat remains asleep.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, continues to sleep soundly on his back on the couch, his whiskers twitching slightly with each breath. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands near Tom's head, holding a small white feather between his paws. The camera remains steady as Jerry carefully positions the feather directly under Tom's nose, gently placing it so that the tip barely touches Tom's nostrils.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, is lying on his back on the couch with his face beginning to scrunch up, his nose twitching from the feather placed underneath it. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands back slightly with his paws clasped together in anticipation, watching Tom's face closely. The camera captures Tom's expression as his eyes squeeze tighter, his nostrils flare, and he inhales deeply before releasing a powerful sneeze that blows Jerry backward through the air toward the open window.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The exterior view of a house shows an open window with white curtains gently fluttering. The wall is cream-colored brick, and a green garden is visible below with various colorful flowers in bloom. Jerry, the brown mouse, is visible flying through the air from the window, arms and legs spread wide with a surprised expression on his face. The camera follows Jerry's trajectory as he soars through the air in a gentle arc, descending toward the garden below with the sunlight highlighting his brown fur against the blue sky.

A lush garden with vibrant flowers of red, yellow, and purple surrounds a collection of terracotta pots arranged in a row near the house. The garden soil is rich brown, and small patches of green grass grow between the flowerbeds. Jerry, the brown mouse, is descending through the air toward a large terracotta flower pot filled with soil and sprouting yellow daisies. The camera pans slightly downward, following Jerry as he falls with his arms outstretched, his expression changing from surprise to curiosity as he notices the flower pot directly below him.

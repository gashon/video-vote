A spacious kitchen with cream-colored walls, a tiled floor, and wooden countertops. A refrigerator stands against one wall, and sunlight streams through a window above the sink. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is sleeping peacefully on a round cushion near the center of the kitchen floor, his body curled up and his eyes closed. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on a nearby countertop next to a plate with several chocolate chip cookies, eyeing them with interest. Jerry reaches forward with both paws and carefully lifts one cookie from the plate, holding it with both hands. The camera follows Jerry as he looks cautiously at Tom before beginning to move away from the plate with the cookie.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains asleep on his round cushion, his chest rising and falling gently with each breath. Jerry, the brown mouse, is walking across the countertop, carefully holding a chocolate chip cookie that is almost as big as he is. Jerry glances back at Tom while walking toward the edge of the counter, making sure the cat is still sleeping. The camera pans slowly following Jerry as he continues his careful journey with the cookie, approaching the edge of the countertop.<end_scene>

Jerry looks over his shoulder at the sleeping Tom while continuing his slow walk toward the safety of his home. The camera follows at floor level as Jerry approaches the mouse hole, maintaining a steady pace while carrying his prize.

Jerry, the brown mouse, pokes his head out from his mouse hole, looking pleased with himself after successfully storing the cookie inside. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is now standing directly over the mouse hole, looking down with an angry expression, his tail swishing slowly behind him. The camera remains fixed on this scene as Jerry's expression changes from satisfaction to surprise as he notices Tom's presence above him.

Jerry, the brown mouse, is halfway out of his mouse hole, looking up with a worried expression. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is standing over Jerry with a wooden pencil held in his right paw, positioned vertically above Jerry's head. Tom slowly lowers the pencil, point down, onto Jerry's head, causing Jerry's body to compress slightly as the pencil makes contact. The camera zooms in slightly as Tom uses the pencil like a tiny hammer on Jerry's head, with Jerry's expression changing to one of discomfort.

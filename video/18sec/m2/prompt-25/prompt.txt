A spacious kitchen with cream-colored walls, white-tiled floors, and wooden cabinets. A wooden door stands on the right side of the frame next to a small round table. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is standing on a small step stool near the door, carefully balancing a metal bucket filled with water on top of the partially open door. Tom's paws are extended upward, making small adjustments to ensure the bucket sits perfectly on the door's edge. The camera remains static as Tom finishes positioning the trap, then steps down from the stool and moves to the side of the door with a satisfied expression.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, is now crouched behind the small round table, his body low to the ground and his tail curled around his paws. His eyes are fixed on the door with the water bucket balanced on top, and a mischievous grin spreads across his face. The camera slowly zooms in on Tom's face as he brings a paw to his mouth, suppressing a snicker while his ears perk up at the sound of small footsteps approaching from beyond the door.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains hidden behind the small round table, his whiskers twitching in anticipation as his eyes widen with excitement. His paws grip the edge of the table as he leans forward slightly, mouth forming an expectant smile as he watches the door with the precariously balanced water bucket. The camera pans slightly to include both Tom and the door in frame as Tom's tail swishes slowly from side to side, his body tensing as the footsteps beyond the door grow louder.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A cozy living room with light blue wallpaper, a large window on the left wall allowing sunlight to stream in, and a patterned rug covering the wooden floor. A comfortable armchair sits in the corner near a small coffee table. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on the windowsill holding a small wedge of yellow cheese in his paws, looking outward through the open window. A skinny orange alley cat sits outside on the windowsill, its eyes fixed hungrily on the cheese Jerry is offering. The camera frames both Jerry and the orange cat as Jerry extends his arms, holding out the cheese piece toward the eager cat who leans forward slightly, whiskers twitching.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, appears in the doorway on the right side of the room, his eyes widening at the sight of the other cat. The camera widens to show the entire room as Tom begins walking toward the window, his expression changing from surprise to anger as he raises his paws in a threatening gesture.

A comfortable armchair sits in the corner near a small coffee table. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is now completely soaked, standing in the middle of the room with water dripping from his fur onto the floor beneath him. An empty metal bucket lies on its side near his feet, while Jerry, the brown mouse, remains on the windowsill, now covering his mouth with both paws to suppress laughter. The camera holds steady on the scene as Tom's shoulders slump in defeat, his fur matted down with water while a small puddle forms around his feet on the patterned rug.

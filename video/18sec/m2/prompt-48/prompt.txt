A cozy living room with beige walls, a wooden floor, and a red sofa against the wall. A small round table sits in the center of the room, and sunlight streams through white curtained windows. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is curled up asleep on the red sofa with his eyes closed and his paws tucked under his body. A white ceramic bowl filled with milk sits on the floor near the sofa. Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks out from behind a potted plant in the corner, his eyes fixed on Tom sleeping on the sofa. The camera remains stationary as Jerry tiptoes slowly from behind the plant toward the bowl of milk, carefully glancing at Tom to ensure he remains asleep.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, continues to sleep soundly on the red sofa, his chest rising and falling with each breath. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands beside the white ceramic bowl of milk on the floor, holding a small can labeled 'White Paint' in his paws. The camera zooms in slightly as Jerry carefully pours the white paint from the can into the bowl, replacing the milk with an identical-looking white substance while occasionally glancing up at Tom to make sure he's still asleep.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, stirs on the red sofa, stretching his front legs forward and opening his eyes slowly. Jerry, the brown mouse, scurries behind the sofa, leaving the white ceramic bowl now filled with white paint sitting innocently on the floor. The camera follows Tom as he yawns widely, showing his pink tongue and teeth, then steps down from the sofa and walks toward the white bowl on the floor, looking thirsty.

<start_scene>A bathroom with light blue tiled walls, a white sink with silver faucets, and a large rectangular mirror mounted above it. A toothbrush holder sits on the right side of the sink and a cup on the left. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands on his hind legs in front of the sink, his front paws gripping the edge of the porcelain as he looks up at his reflection in the mirror. The camera is positioned behind Tom, capturing both his back and his reflection in the mirror as he slowly raises his head to look at himself, his eyes growing wider as he sees his face.

A bathroom with light blue tiled walls, a white sink with silver faucets, and a large rectangular mirror mounted above it. A toothbrush holder sits on the right side of the sink and a cup on the left. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands completely still in front of the mirror, his jaw hanging open in shock as he stares at his reflection, his entire face now painted white from the paint he mistook for milk. Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks around the bathroom doorframe, pointing at Tom and silently laughing. The camera zooms in on Tom's horrified expression in the mirror as he touches his white-painted face with his paw, leaving a paw print in the white paint covering his whiskers and cheeks.

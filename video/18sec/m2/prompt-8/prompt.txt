A cozy kitchen with white cabinets, tiled flooring, and a marble countertop. A small window above the sink allows sunlight to filter in, illuminating the space. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is curled up on a red cushion in the corner of the kitchen, his eyes closed and his chest rising and falling with each breath as he naps. Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges from a small hole in the baseboard, glancing cautiously at the sleeping cat before creeping toward a white ceramic bowl filled with milk that sits on the floor near Tom's cushion.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains asleep on the red cushion, his tail occasionally twitching as he dreams. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands beside Tom's milk bowl with a mischievous grin, carefully placing a small tin of white paint next to the bowl. The mouse tilts the paint tin and slowly pours its contents into the ceramic bowl, replacing the milk with white paint while frequently looking back at Tom to ensure he remains asleep.<end_scene>

Tom, the blue-gray cat, stretches his limbs as he awakens from his nap, his eyes opening slowly as he yawns and reveals his sharp teeth. Jerry, the brown mouse, hides behind a large book on a nearby bookshelf, peering over the edge with anticipation as Tom spots the white ceramic bowl now placed in the center of the living room and walks toward it with a pleased expression.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, approaches the white ceramic bowl in the center of the room, lowering his head and extending his tongue to eagerly lap at what he believes is milk. Jerry, the brown mouse, continues watching from behind the book on the bookshelf, covering his mouth with both paws to suppress his giggling as Tom dips his face into the bowl and begins drinking the disguised paint.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, lifts his head from the bowl with his entire face now covered in white paint, giving him a ghostly appearance as drops of paint drip from his whiskers onto the floor. Jerry, the brown mouse, still positioned behind the book, watches with wide eyes and a hand over his mouth as Tom's expression changes from satisfaction to confusion while he examines the white substance dripping from his chin.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands with his eyes bulging in shock and his mouth open in a silent shriek as he realizes his face is completely covered in white paint, his paws reaching up to touch his paint-covered cheeks. Jerry, the brown mouse, falls backward behind the book, rolling silently with laughter while clutching his stomach, occasionally peeking over the edge of the book to admire his successful prank on the distressed cat.

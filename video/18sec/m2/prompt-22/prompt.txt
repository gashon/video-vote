A bright, spacious kitchen with white cabinets, a tiled floor, and a small dining table. A refrigerator stands against the wall, and sunlight streams through a window above the sink. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is standing on the kitchen floor with a small wooden mousetrap in his paws, carefully placing it near the wall. The mousetrap has a small piece of yellow cheese attached to its trigger mechanism. Tom places the mousetrap on the floor and positions the cheese, arming the trap with deliberate movements while glancing around to ensure no one is watching.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands back from the mousetrap he has placed on the floor, a smug grin spreading across his face as he admires his work. The mousetrap sits on the tiled floor with the cheese bait prominently displayed, while Tom nods with satisfaction. Tom turns away from the trap and walks toward the kitchen doorway, his tail swishing side to side as he glances over his shoulder one last time at his trap.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A comfortable living room with a beige couch against a light blue wall, a coffee table in the center, and a television set in the corner. A floor lamp provides soft lighting, and a window with curtains shows it's daytime outside. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is relaxing on the couch with his paws behind his head and his legs stretched out. His expression is content as he watches the television screen, which displays moving images that reflect in his eyes. Tom shifts slightly to get more comfortable on the couch cushions, his tail curved lazily over the edge as he continues to watch the television with half-lidded eyes.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains lounging on the couch while Jerry, the brown mouse, appears at the entrance to the living room, pushing the wooden mousetrap with the cheese still attached. The small brown mouse carefully edges the mousetrap across the floor toward the couch where Tom is lying. Jerry maneuvers the mousetrap closer to Tom's tail, which is hanging off the edge of the couch, while Tom remains oblivious as he focuses on the television.

Jerry, the brown mouse, positions the wooden mousetrap directly beneath Tom's blue-gray tail, which dangles from the edge of the couch. Tom, the blue-gray cat, continues watching television, completely unaware of Jerry's presence or the mousetrap below his tail. Jerry steps back from the trap and gently nudges Tom's tail downward toward the trigger of the mousetrap, his small paws pushing with careful determination.

A floor lamp provides soft lighting, and a window with curtains shows it's daytime outside. The wooden mousetrap has snapped shut on Tom's tail, causing the blue-gray cat to leap upward with his mouth open in a howl of pain, his eyes wide with shock. Jerry, the brown mouse, sits nearby with the piece of cheese in his paws, a satisfied smile on his face as he takes a small bite. Tom arches his back in pain, his paws reaching toward his trapped tail while Jerry continues to enjoy the cheese, watching Tom's suffering with clear delight.

A cozy living room with a beige sofa against a light blue wall. A wooden coffee table sits in the center, and a large goldfish bowl with a single orange goldfish is placed prominently on a small side table near the window. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is napping peacefully on the beige sofa, his head resting on a small cushion and his tail curled around his body. The goldfish in the bowl swims in slow circles, occasionally blowing bubbles that rise to the surface of the water. The camera remains static, capturing the peaceful scene with Tom sleeping soundly while the goldfish moves gently in its bowl.

A cozy living room with a beige sofa against a light blue wall. A wooden coffee table sits in the center, and a small side table near the window now has only a folded piece of paper where the goldfish bowl used to be. Tom, the blue-gray cat, continues to sleep on the beige sofa, his chest rising and falling with each breath, completely unaware of the missing fishbowl. Jerry, the brown mouse, is visible at the edge of the frame, carefully lifting the goldfish bowl with both paws, moving slowly toward the doorway that leads outside. The camera slowly pans to follow Jerry as he cautiously carries the heavy fishbowl, taking deliberate steps toward the open door while frequently glancing back at the sleeping Tom.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A lush garden with bright green grass, colorful flower beds, and a large oak tree providing dappled shade. A garden bench sits to one side, and a small stone path winds through the grass. Jerry, the brown mouse, is setting down the goldfish bowl on a flat stone in a sunny patch of grass, carefully adjusting its position with both paws to ensure it's stable. The orange goldfish circles inside the bowl, appearing confused by the change of scenery as Jerry steps back to admire his work. The camera zooms out slightly to show Jerry standing proudly next to the fishbowl, now placed in the middle of a small clearing in the garden, as he reaches into a tiny pouch he's carrying.

A lush garden with bright green grass, colorful flower beds, and a large oak tree providing dappled shade. A garden bench sits to one side, and a small stone path winds through the grass. Jerry, the brown mouse, is now placing a tiny wooden diving board on the rim of the fishbowl, securing it carefully with his paws and testing it with one foot to make sure it's stable. The orange goldfish watches from inside the bowl as Jerry pulls out a miniature pair of sunglasses from his pouch and places them over his eyes. The camera pans slightly to show Jerry climbing onto the edge of the fishbowl, adjusting his sunglasses, and moving toward the tiny diving board with a satisfied smile on his face.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The garden path leads to a stone patio area with potted plants scattered around and the goldfish bowl prominently displayed on a flat stone. The sun casts warm light across the scene, creating a vacation-like atmosphere. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is standing at the edge of the patio, his eyes wide with shock and his mouth slightly open as he stares at the scene before him. Jerry, the brown mouse, is perched on the tiny diving board attached to the goldfish bowl, wearing miniature sunglasses and striking a diving pose with his arms outstretched. The camera angle captures both Tom's stunned expression and Jerry's carefree pose, as the orange goldfish swims in panicked circles inside the bowl beneath the diving board.

The garden path leads to a stone patio area with potted plants scattered around and the goldfish bowl prominently displayed on a flat stone. The sun casts warm light across the scene, creating a vacation-like atmosphere. Tom, the blue-gray cat, takes a single step forward with his paw extended, his face transitioning from shock to anger as his eyebrows furrow and his tail begins to twitch. Jerry, the brown mouse, remains oblivious to Tom's presence, dipping one toe into the water of the fishbowl to test the temperature while adjusting his miniature sunglasses with his other paw. The camera slowly zooms in on Tom's face as his expression darkens, his whiskers twitching with irritation while Jerry continues his poolside preparations in blissful ignorance.

A cozy bedroom with light blue walls, a simple wooden dresser, and a small window with curtains partially drawn. A large wooden door stands slightly ajar at the entrance of the room. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on a small step stool next to the door, carefully balancing a white ceramic bowl filled with milk. Jerry carefully places the bowl of milk on the top edge of the partially open door, adjusting it with his paws to ensure perfect balance. The camera remains steady, showing Jerry stepping back to admire his handiwork as the bowl teeters slightly before settling into position.

A cozy bedroom with light blue walls, a simple wooden dresser, and a small window with curtains partially drawn. A large wooden door stands slightly ajar at the entrance of the room. Tom, the blue-gray cat, lies curled up on a round pet bed in the corner of the room, his eyes closed and chest rising and falling with deep, peaceful breaths. Jerry, the brown mouse, tiptoes away from the balanced milk bowl, looking back over his shoulder with a mischievous smile as he heads toward the door. The camera slowly pans to follow Jerry as he carefully makes his way across the room.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A bright kitchen with yellow walls, white cabinets, and a tiled floor. A wooden rolling pin lies on the floor near the base of the stairs that lead up to the second floor. Tom, the blue-gray cat, enters the kitchen from the right side of the frame, walking casually with a sleepy expression on his face, his eyes half-closed and his tail swaying lazily behind him. The camera follows Tom as he moves across the kitchen floor, unaware of the rolling pin directly in his path, his paw about to step on the cylindrical wooden object.

A bright kitchen with yellow walls, white cabinets, and a tiled floor. A wooden rolling pin lies on the floor near the base of the stairs that lead up to the second floor. Tom, the blue-gray cat, steps directly onto the rolling pin, his eyes widening in surprise as his foot slides forward, causing him to lose his balance. Tom's arms windmill as he tries to regain his footing, his body tilting backward toward the staircase as the rolling pin moves beneath his weight. The camera angle widens to capture both Tom and the staircase as he begins to topple backward.

A wooden staircase connecting the kitchen to the second floor, with a wall railing on one side and open space on the other. Tom, the blue-gray cat, tumbles backward down the stairs, his body somersaulting as his limbs splay outward, his expression showing shock and discomfort. The camera pans down to follow Tom's descent, capturing each bounce as he rolls down the staircase, his tail flicking with each impact, approaching the bottom where the doorway to his bedroom is visible.

A cozy bedroom with light blue walls, a simple wooden dresser, and a small window with curtains partially drawn. A large wooden door stands slightly ajar at the entrance of the room. Tom, the blue-gray cat, crashes into the partially open bedroom door, causing it to swing open with force, dislodging the bowl of milk perched on top. The white milk splashes down onto Tom's head and fur, completely drenching him as he sits dazed on the floor. The camera remains stationary as Tom blinks slowly, his fur dripping with milk, forming a puddle beneath him on the wooden floor.

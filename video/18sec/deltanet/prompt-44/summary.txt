The spacious kitchen features pristine white tiled floors, honey-colored wooden cabinets, and a large off-white refrigerator positioned flush against the left wall, while golden sunlight filters through a rectangular window on the right, casting elongated shadows across the polished countertops. Outside, Jerry stands in a vibrant garden beside a small gray stone with jagged edges, his tiny brown paws carefully positioning it inside a terracotta flower pot with a visible hairline crack along its rim, causing the pot to tilt precariously toward the partially-opened kitchen window. The flower pot's descent creates a visible shockwave of movement as it crashes loudly, startling Tom who leaps backward with arched back and flattened ears, colliding with the refrigerator door which swings open on its squeaky hinges. The glass of milk, previously balanced on the refrigerator door's edge with condensation droplets sliding down its exterior, tips over in slow motion, its white contents cascading directly onto Tom's head and saturating his blue-gray fur from his pointed ears to his shoulders, leaving him frozen in place with widened eyes, dripping whiskers, and an open-mouthed expression of utter disbelief.

A spacious kitchen with white tiled floors, wooden cabinets, and a large refrigerator against the left wall. The countertops are clean with a few kitchen appliances visible, and sunlight streams through a window on the right. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands on his hind legs beside the refrigerator, carefully balancing a full glass of milk on top of the refrigerator door. Tom places the glass precisely at the edge of the refrigerator door, then steps back with a satisfied grin, looking towards a small mouse hole in the baseboard across the room.

Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks his head out from a small circular hole in the baseboard, his eyes focused on Tom and the glass of milk balanced on the refrigerator door. Jerry watches Tom's trap with caution, then slowly withdraws back into his mouse hole, his expression thoughtful as he considers his next move.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, crouches behind the kitchen table, his eyes fixed on the mouse hole, waiting for Jerry to emerge.

The kitchen window is partially open, allowing a view inside to the refrigerator. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands beside a small gray stone that he holds in his paws, looking up at a red clay flower pot positioned at the edge of the windowsill. Jerry carefully places the stone into the flower pot, causing it to tilt slightly toward the edge of the windowsill, then steps back with an anticipatory expression.

The kitchen window is partially open, allowing a view inside to the refrigerator. The red clay flower pot teeters at the edge of the windowsill, gradually tipping further over the edge as the stone inside shifts its weight.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, startled by the noise, bumps backward into the refrigerator door, causing it to swing open. The glass of milk that was balanced on top of the refrigerator door tips over and pours directly onto Tom's head, drenching his blue-gray fur completely as he stands there with a shocked expression.

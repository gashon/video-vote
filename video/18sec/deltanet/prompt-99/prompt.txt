A clean kitchen with light blue walls, white tiles on the floor, and a wooden table in the center. A plate with several cookies sits on the table, illuminated by sunlight streaming through a nearby window. Tom, the blue-gray cat, sits at the table with his back turned, focused on reading a newspaper. Jerry, the brown mouse, creeps along the edge of the table, approaching the cookie plate with small, careful steps. Jerry reaches the plate, looks around cautiously, then picks up one of the cookies which is almost as big as he is.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, continues to read his newspaper, unaware of what's happening behind him. Jerry, the brown mouse, holds the large cookie in both paws and slowly brings it to his mouth, taking a big bite that leaves visible crumbs falling to the table. Jerry chews the cookie with his cheeks bulging, a satisfied expression on his face as cookie crumbs drop onto the floor, forming a visible trail.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, puts down his newspaper and stretches his arms above his head, yawning widely. Jerry, the brown mouse, stuffs the remainder of the cookie into his mouth, his cheeks puffed out comically. Jerry turns and walks away from the table, leaving a trail of cookie crumbs behind him as he heads toward the doorway leading to the living room.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A cozy living room with beige walls, a brown sofa against the wall, and a patterned area rug on the hardwood floor. A coffee table sits in the center with magazines neatly stacked on it, and curtains frame a large window. Tom, the blue-gray cat, enters the living room with a puzzled expression, looking down at the floor. Jerry is not visible in the scene. Tom follows the trail of cookie crumbs with his eyes, bending down slightly to examine them more carefully. The camera pans slowly along the crumb trail as Tom walks beside it, his tail swishing methodically from side to side.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands in the middle of the room, his eyes still following the trail of cookie crumbs that leads to a plush red cushion on the floor near the sofa. Jerry, the brown mouse, lies fast asleep on the cushion, his tiny body rising and falling with each breath, a few cookie crumbs still visible around his mouth. The camera moves in closer to Jerry as Tom approaches the cushion, his footsteps slow and deliberate.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands over the red cushion, looking down at Jerry with his paws on his hips. Jerry, the brown mouse, sleeps peacefully on the cushion, a content smile on his face, with a small thought bubble appearing above his head showing a giant cookie. Tom's expression softens from anger to slight amusement as he watches Jerry dream, his raised paw lowering slowly as he decides not to disturb the sleeping mouse.

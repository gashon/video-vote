Jerry, the brown mouse, stands securely within his circular mouse hole in the white baseboard, his small body shaking with unrestrained laughter as he clutches his stomach with both paws, tears of mirth forming at the corners of his eyes while his buck teeth gleam in the dim light of his sanctuary. A minuscule wedge of yellow cheese with tiny holes sits just inside the entrance, untouched and acting as a tantalizing decoy, while the light yellow wall surrounding the hole creates a warm backdrop to the scene. Tom's furious face dominates the mouse hole entrance, his blue-gray fur bristling with rage, whiskers twitching spasmodically, and yellow eyes narrowed to slits as he emits a silent hiss, while his large gray paw with extended claws swipes repeatedly and desperately at the opening, scraping against the edges of the hole that's merely a fraction of his size.

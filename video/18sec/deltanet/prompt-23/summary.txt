The cozy living room features a plush carpet, large sofa adorned with decorative pillows arranged asymmetrically, and a central coffee table with several magazines fanned out on its surface. A crackling fireplace with three modestly-sized logs emits a warm amber glow that creates intricate shadow patterns on the textured beige walls while highlighting the subtle floral pattern on the room's vintage wallpaper border. Jerry, a small brown mouse with oversized rounded ears and a pink nose, enters from the left with his cheeks puffed out from exertion, his tiny paws gripping the bottom of an irregularly-shaped yellow cheese chunk with visible holes that towers over his diminutive frame, causing him to wobble slightly with each determined step across the carpet's thick pile.

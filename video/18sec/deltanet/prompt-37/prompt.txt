Sunlight streams through a window above the sink, illuminating the room with a warm glow. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on the kitchen counter near a white ceramic bowl filled with milk. He holds a small paint can labeled 'White Paint' in his tiny paws, looking around cautiously. Jerry carefully pours the white paint into Tom's milk bowl, replacing the milk with an identical-looking substance, while occasionally glancing over his shoulder to ensure he isn't being watched.

A brown sofa sits in the center with a small coffee table in front of it and a lamp on a side table. Tom, the blue-gray cat, walks into the living room from the left side of the frame, his paws moving stiffly and his eyes widening with dawning realization.

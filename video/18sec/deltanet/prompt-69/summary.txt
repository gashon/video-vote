The blue-gray cat Tom stands in the middle of a kitchen with white tiled floors, yellow walls, and wooden cabinets, displaying a completely bewildered expression with his arms outstretched dramatically in confusion. His eyes dart left and right searchingly before he thoughtfully places one paw on his chin, his whiskers twitching slightly as he stares down at the round wooden table where a plate of cookies sits with visible crumbs scattered across its surface, his puzzled frown deepening as he tilts his head slightly to one side, ears flattened in frustration.

The spacious white-walled kitchen features a refrigerator on the left and wooden cabinets with a counter of appliances along the right wall, while Tom, the blue-gray cat, meticulously positions a wooden board trap with cheese bait in the center of the tiled floor, his whiskers twitching with concentration as he makes precise adjustments. Jerry, the brown mouse, approaches the trap with cautious intelligence, his whiskers quivering as he skillfully extracts the cheese without triggering the mechanism, then proudly carries his oversized prize—clutched against his chest with both paws—toward his mousehole in the lower right corner. Inside Jerry's cozy earthen-walled home, furnished with tiny wooden pieces and illuminated by a beam of light through a small window, he savors his cheese with evident delight, rubbing his paws together before taking a satisfying bite, while back in the kitchen, Tom stands defeated near the refrigerator, his shoulders slumped, tail drooping, and paws clenched before deliberately banging his head against the wall with a dull thud.

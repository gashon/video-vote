The small bathroom features light blue tiled walls, a white porcelain sink with an oval mirror mounted above it, and a toilet partially visible in the corner, all illuminated by harsh fluorescent ceiling lights that create subtle shadows beneath the fixtures. Tom, the blue-gray cat with distinctive long whiskers and rounded ears, stands horrified on his hind legs before the mirror, his yellow eyes bulging dramatically outward with tiny red veins visible while his front paws press against his furry cheeks in an expression of absolute shock. His abnormally enlarged tongue, completely coated in thick white paint that drips tiny droplets onto the sink below, protrudes grotesquely from his open mouth and continues to swell visibly with each passing second, stretching to nearly three times its normal size as Tom's reflection shows the full extent of his predicament. The bathroom's tile floor reflects a faint bluish tinge from the walls, while a small green toothbrush can be spotted in a cup beside the sink and a partially unrolled toilet paper roll hangs on the wall beside the toilet.

In the warm-toned living room with beige sofa against light green walls, Jerry the brown mouse contentedly devours a cheese sandwich nearly his own size while perched on the wooden coffee table, his tiny cheeks bulging with each satisfied bite. Tom the blue-gray cat appears in the doorway with salt crystals visibly clinging to his whiskers and nose—remnants from a kitchen mishap—his facial muscles twitching as another sneeze builds, eyes beginning to water. The scene culminates with Tom's powerful sneeze erupting, his entire body hunched forward with eyes tightly squeezed shut and mouth agape, sending salt particles flying from his whiskers while Jerry watches with clear amusement, clutching the final morsel of his sandwich between his tiny paws.

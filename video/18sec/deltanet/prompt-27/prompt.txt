A spacious kitchen with white cabinets, beige countertops, and a tiled floor stretches across the background. A small container labeled 'catnip' sits prominently on the counter next to salt and pepper shakers. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on the countertop next to the catnip container, holding a small bag of pepper in his tiny paws. With a mischievous expression, Jerry carefully opens the catnip container and gently empties the contents behind the counter, then begins to pour the pepper from his bag into the now-empty catnip container.

Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on the countertop beside the now pepper-filled catnip container, closing the lid with a satisfied expression. Jerry places the lid back on the catnip container and steps back to admire his handiwork, a wide grin spreading across his face as he rubs his paws together in anticipation.

Jerry, the brown mouse, stands at the edge of the countertop, looking over his shoulder at the catnip container with a sly grin. The brown mouse takes slow, deliberate steps toward the corner of the counter, then carefully climbs down using a kitchen towel hanging from the edge, his eyes occasionally glancing back at the doctored catnip container.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A cozy living room with a floral-patterned sofa, wooden coffee table, and a ceiling fan hanging from the center of the ceiling. A large window with curtains allows afternoon sunlight to filter into the room, casting soft shadows on the carpeted floor. Tom, the blue-gray cat, walks into the living room holding the container of catnip, his tail swishing slowly from side to side in anticipation. The cat sits down on the carpet, places the container in front of him, and removes the lid with careful paws, his whiskers twitching as he leans forward to sniff the contents.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, sits on the carpet with the open catnip container in front of him, his nose hovering just above the container's opening. Tom's eyes widen as he inhales deeply over the container, his expression shifting from delight to confusion as his nose begins to twitch and his eyes start to water.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, sits on the carpet with an expression of mounting distress, his chest expanding as he prepares to sneeze. Tom's body tenses as he releases an enormous sneeze, the force of which propels him upward toward the ceiling fan, his arms and legs splayed outward as he collides with the slowly spinning blades.

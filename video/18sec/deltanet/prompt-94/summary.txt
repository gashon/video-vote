In a sunlit living room with beige walls and wooden floors, Jerry the brown mouse sleeps peacefully curled into a ball on a small cushion near the window, his whiskers occasionally twitching while his tiny chest rises and falls rhythmically. Tom the blue-gray cat stealthily approaches on tiptoes with hunched posture, but inadvertently knocks over a clay flower pot containing a small green plant, which topples from a nearby table and spills soil across the floorboards, briefly waking Jerry who merely yawns, stretches his tiny arms overhead, and promptly returns to sleep, leaving Tom to depart with slumped shoulders and dragging tail in defeated resignation.

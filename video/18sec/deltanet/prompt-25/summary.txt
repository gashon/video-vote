The spacious kitchen features cream-colored walls, white-tiled floors, and wooden cabinets, with a wooden door positioned on the right side next to a small round table. Tom, the blue-gray cat, crouches stealthily behind the round table with his body low to the ground and tail curled around his paws, his mischievous grin widening as he fixes his gaze on the door where he's balanced a metal water bucket. His whiskers twitch noticeably in anticipation while his ears perk up at approaching footsteps, and he brings a paw to his mouth to suppress a snicker, his tail swishing slowly side-to-side. The camera gradually zooms in on Tom's expectant face before panning to include both the hidden cat and the door in frame, capturing his widening eyes and tensing body as he grips the table's edge and leans forward slightly, the footsteps beyond the door growing increasingly louder.

A bright kitchen with tiled floors, wooden cabinets, and a refrigerator in the background. A sandwich sits on a plate on the kitchen counter, with lettuce and tomato visible between slices of bread. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on the counter next to the sandwich, holding a small piece of yellow cheese in his paws. Jerry carefully lifts up the top slice of bread on the sandwich, revealing layers of lettuce and tomato underneath. As the camera zooms in slightly, Jerry removes a slice of cheese from inside the sandwich and replaces it with a small yellow sponge that looks identical to the cheese.

Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on the kitchen counter next to the sandwich with a piece of cheese in his paws and a mischievous expression. Jerry gently places the top slice of bread back on the sandwich, arranging it to look undisturbed. As the camera pans slightly to follow his movement, Jerry steps back to admire his handiwork, then glances toward the doorway as if hearing approaching footsteps.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A cozy living room with beige walls, a brown sofa, and a small coffee table in the center. A large window with curtains is visible on the left wall, allowing sunlight to stream into the room. Tom, the blue-gray cat, enters from the right side of the frame, holding a plate with the sandwich as he walks toward the coffee table. Tom sits down on the sofa, placing the plate on his lap while looking hungrily at the sandwich. The camera moves slightly to center on Tom as he picks up the sandwich with both paws, bringing it closer to his mouth.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, sits on the sofa with the plate on his lap, holding the sandwich near his mouth. Tom opens his mouth wide and takes a large bite of the sandwich, chewing twice with a satisfied expression. The camera zooms in slowly as Tom's expression changes from satisfaction to confusion, his eyebrows raising and whiskers twitching as he tastes something unexpected.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, sits on the sofa with the partially eaten sandwich in his paws, and a concerned expression on his face. Tom's eyes suddenly bulge outward in shock, and his face gradually turns from blue-gray to a sickly green color. The camera holds steady on Tom as he looks down at the sandwich, pulling apart the bread to reveal the yellow sponge inside, his expression changing to anger.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The living room shows the brown sofa from the side angle, with a decorative cushion positioned at one end. A small wooden side table is visible next to the sofa, and the beige wall forms the background. Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks out from behind the cushion on the sofa, with only his head and part of his body visible. Jerry watches Tom's reaction with wide eyes and a paw covering his mouth. As the camera slowly zooms in, Jerry's body shakes slightly as he struggles to contain his laughter, his eyes crinkling at the corners with delight at the success of his prank.

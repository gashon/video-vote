The kitchen with light blue walls, wooden cabinets, and small round table covered by a red and white checkered tablecloth displays numerous milk splatters across every surface, with particularly large droplets sliding down the cabinet doors. Tom's blue-gray fur is completely saturated with milk, creating a darker wet appearance while his whiskers droop under the weight of clinging droplets, his yellow eyes wide with a combination of shock and humiliation as his ears lay flat against his head. Jerry perches precariously on Tom's pink nose, his brown fur glistening with moisture while tiny milk droplets form at the tips of his whiskers, his small black eyes twinkling with mischief as he maintains a wide buck-toothed grin with his right eye closed in a deliberate wink toward the viewer. The mouse's thin pink tail curls slightly behind him for balance while his diminutive arms cross confidently across his chest, his tiny fingers visible as they grip his upper arms in a gesture of smug satisfaction.

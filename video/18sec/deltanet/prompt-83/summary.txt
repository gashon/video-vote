The meticulously maintained kitchen features a checkered black-and-white tile floor, light green walls with subtle paint texture, and polished wooden cabinets with brass handles gleaming in the soft daylight streaming through a rectangular window positioned directly above the porcelain sink. Tom, the blue-gray cat with distinctive darker stripes across his back, sits dazed on the living room's beige carpet beside the small round mouse hole, his whiskers bent at odd angles, eyes crossed and unfocused, with tiny yellow cartoon stars circling counterclockwise above his slightly flattened head. Jerry's triumphant face peeks from the safety of his perfectly circular mouse hole cut into the cream-colored baseboard, his brown ears perked up attentively, tiny front teeth visible in his wide smile, and his small black eyes twinkling with mischievous satisfaction at the success of his milk-dripping trap.

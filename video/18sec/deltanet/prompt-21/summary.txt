Jerry, the brown mouse, curls into a perfect ball on the sun-drenched windowsill beside his abandoned book, his tiny whiskers twitching occasionally with each gentle breath while his minuscule paws are tucked beneath his cinnamon-colored fur that glows golden where the afternoon light strikes it directly. Tom, the blue-gray cat, lies completely surrendered to sleep on his crimson cushion, his striped tail occasionally twitching in dream-state, whiskers drooping relaxedly, one ear slightly folded back against his head, and his chest rising and falling in perfect rhythm with a barely audible purr escaping his slightly parted mouth.

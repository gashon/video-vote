A cozy living room with wooden furniture, soft cream-colored walls, and a plush carpet. A comfortable armchair sits near a small side table with a reading lamp casting a warm glow. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is sleeping peacefully on the armchair, his eyes closed and his body curled up comfortably. Jerry, the brown mouse, approaches the sleeping Tom while carefully carrying a hardcover book in his paws. Jerry gently places the book on Tom's face, balancing it carefully so it rests flat across the cat's eyes and nose.

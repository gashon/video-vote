A wooden kitchen table sits in the middle of a bright kitchen with white tiled floors and yellow-painted walls. Overhead lights cast a warm glow on the polished wooden surface of the table. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is seated at the table, looking down at a yellow slice of cheese positioned in front of him. Tom reaches his paw forward toward the slice of cheese, unaware of Jerry who is approaching the table from the right side of the frame. The camera remains stationary, focused on Tom and the cheese as Jerry moves slowly into view.

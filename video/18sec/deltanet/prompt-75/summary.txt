The meticulously arranged dining room features yellow wallpaper with subtle floral patterns, an ornate wooden table with intricate carvings on its legs, and a crystal chandelier with prismatic light reflections dancing across the walls. Tom, the blue-gray cat with whiskers twitching and a pink nose, experiences an explosive reaction to the pepper-laced sandwich, his fur momentarily standing on end as his powerful sneeze launches partially-chewed sandwich bits in a perfect arc across the polished tabletop, some pieces sticking to the chandelier above. Jerry, the small brown mouse with oversized ears and a pink tail curled in surprise, tumbles through the air with his tiny paws windmilling frantically before plunging into a decorative milk-filled bowl positioned near the edge of the table, creating a crown-shaped splash that sends droplets of milk onto the lace tablecloth and leaving him completely drenched with milk dripping from his whiskers and ears.

The meticulously maintained kitchen features pristine white tiled floors complemented by soft pale yellow walls and rustic wooden cabinets, with a perfectly centered round wooden table flanked by two chairs and a refrigerator positioned strategically against the far wall beneath checkered curtains that filter morning light. Tom, the blue-gray cat with distinctive white paws and chest markings, stands with slightly hunched shoulders at the table, carefully setting down a small ceramic bowl filled to the brim with creamy white milk that creates tiny ripples as it's placed directly in front of Jerry, whose tiny pink nose twitches excitedly while his delicate whiskers quiver in anticipation, his round ears perked forward and bright black eyes gleaming with satisfaction.

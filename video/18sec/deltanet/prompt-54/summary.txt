The spacious kitchen features a checkerboard pattern of white and blue floor tiles, wooden cabinets with visible grain texture lining the walls, and a small rectangular window through which golden sunlight streams, casting elongated shadows across the countertops. In the corner by a white refrigerator with chrome handles sits a plush, crimson cushion with slightly frayed edges where Tom, a blue-gray cat with darker stripes on his back and white fur on his chest, sleeps curled in a tight ball, his whiskers occasionally twitching as his ribcage rises and falls rhythmically. Jerry, a small brown mouse with large rounded ears, a pink nose, and a lighter beige underbelly, cautiously emerges from his perfectly circular hole in the baseboard (which has a tiny crack extending from its upper right), his beady black eyes fixated intently on a triangular wedge of bright yellow cheese positioned precariously near the edge of the laminate countertop, small holes visible throughout its surface.

The blue-gray cat Tom returns to the wooden table in the bright yellow-walled kitchen, immediately freezing in place with his whiskers twitching and head tilted sideways in visible confusion upon discovering the cookie's disappearance; his green eyes widen as he scratches behind his right ear with his left paw, mouth slightly agape in a bewildered expression. Meanwhile, partially obscured in the background near the circular mouse hole at the base of the wall, Jerry the brown mouse sits with his tiny paws clutching the enormous chocolate chip cookie, his cheeks bulging as he nibbles contentedly at its edge, eyes closed in delight while crumbs scatter around his feet on the checkered tile floor.

The pristine kitchen corner features a silver water bowl positioned against gleaming white-and-blue tiled flooring adjacent to a stainless steel refrigerator. Tom, the blue-gray cat with distinctive pointed ears and whiskers, rushes frantically into the scene with his pink tongue fully extended and dangling, while thick plumes of white steam billow dramatically from both his triangular ears and the top of his head. His normally sleek fur appears slightly ruffled as his wide, panicked eyes bulge outward, their pupils contracted to pinpoints, while his face displays an intense crimson hue that extends from his cheeks to his forehead. With desperate urgency, Tom crouches down on his front paws beside the water bowl, his whiskers twitching erratically as he frantically laps at the clear liquid with his extended tongue, causing tiny droplets to splash upward while additional waves of steam continue to rise from his overheated head in curling, translucent wisps.

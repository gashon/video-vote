Jerry's mousehole is a cozy round tunnel carved into the white wall with soft edges and simple furnishings visible just inside. A small wooden table with a miniature lamp sits near the entrance of the mousehole. Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks out from his mousehole, his head and paws visible as he stares across the room. Jerry's eyes widen as he spots Tom, the blue-gray cat, sleeping on the floor next to a white bowl of milk, and he slowly steps out of his mousehole while maintaining his gaze on Tom.

A small wooden table with a miniature lamp sits near the entrance of the mousehole. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is curled up on the hardwood floor, sleeping peacefully with his head resting on his paws, while a white ceramic bowl filled with milk sits untouched next to his tail. Jerry, the brown mouse, tiptoes slowly across the floor toward Tom and the bowl, glancing nervously at the sleeping cat while approaching the milk bowl with deliberate, careful steps.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The living room has a beige wall with a wooden baseboard and polished hardwood flooring. A white ceramic bowl sits on the floor with Tom, the blue-gray cat, sleeping beside it with his long tail extended next to the bowl. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands behind the bowl of milk, placing both hands on the edge of the bowl and leaning his weight against it. The camera zooms in slightly as Jerry pushes the bowl, causing it to tilt and spill its contents directly onto Tom's tail, creating a growing puddle beneath it.

The living room has a beige wall with a wooden baseboard and polished hardwood flooring. A white ceramic bowl sits on the floor, now empty and tilted to one side. Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains asleep while his tail lies in a puddle of milk that has spread across the floor in a trail of paw prints leading away from the scene. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands at the edge of the milk puddle, looking down with concern as he notices his own wet footprints clearly marking a path across the floor towards the living room curtains.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The living room features a large window with long green curtains hanging to the floor, framed by the beige wall and wooden baseboard. A trail of small wet paw prints leads across the hardwood floor directly to the edge of the curtain, which bulges slightly at the bottom. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is now awake, walking slowly on all fours with his nose to the ground, following the wet paw prints across the floor. The camera pans slowly alongside Tom as he moves deliberately toward the curtain, pausing occasionally to sniff the wet prints before continuing his tracking.

A trail of small wet paw prints leads across the hardwood floor directly to the edge of the curtain, which bulges slightly at the bottom. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands in front of the curtain, looking down at the end of the trail of wet paw prints disappearing beneath the fabric. Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks out from behind the curtain, his expression changing from curious to alarmed as he sees Tom's paw slowly reaching toward the curtain edge, ready to pull it aside.

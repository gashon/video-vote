The blue-gray cat Tom lies supine on a blue-patterned couch in a beige-walled living room, whiskers subtly twitching during his slumber while sunlight streams through white-curtained windows on the right. Jerry, a brown mouse with a mischievous expression, emerges cautiously from behind a left-side cushion and tiptoes toward Tom's head, periodically glancing over his shoulder to confirm the cat remains asleep. Positioning a small white feather directly beneath Tom's nostrils, Jerry stands back with anticipation, watching as Tom's face scrunches, nostrils flare, and eyes squeeze tighter before releasing a powerful sneeze that propels Jerry backward through the open window. Following his unexpected aerial journey past cream-colored brick exterior and fluttering curtains, Jerry soars in a sunlit arc toward a garden of red, yellow and purple flowers, ultimately landing in a terracotta pot filled with yellow daisies that cushion his fall, where he reclines contentedly with paws behind his head after brushing soil particles from his shoulder.

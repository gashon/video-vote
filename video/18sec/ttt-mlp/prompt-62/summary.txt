The cozy living room features a plush beige carpet, earth-toned furniture, and warm lamp light, with Jerry, a mischievous brown mouse, carefully replacing a catnip toy with a red hot pepper on a small round table while hiding behind a vase. Tom, the blue-gray cat initially lounging on the carpet, notices what he believes is his toy, stalks toward the table in hunting position, then pounces with wiggling rear end to snatch the pepper in his mouth as Jerry watches with anticipatory glee. The scene transitions to a spacious kitchen with white tiles and wooden cabinets where Tom's face turns bright red with bulging eyes and straight whiskers as the spiciness hits, causing him to desperately dunk his entire face into a milk bowl near the refrigerator, eventually sitting beside the empty bowl fanning his still-red face with tears in his eyes while Jerry stands in the doorway bent over in silent laughter.

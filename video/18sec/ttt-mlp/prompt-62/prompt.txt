Jerry, the brown mouse, peers from behind a vase on the table, glancing mischievously at a red hot pepper he holds in his tiny paws. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is stretched out on the carpet nearby, lazily batting at a toy with his paw while facing away from Jerry.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands in the center of the kitchen with the hot pepper in his mouth, his eyes growing progressively wider as the spiciness registers. The camera zooms in slightly as Tom's face turns bright red from the base of his neck to the tips of his ears, his eyes bulging and whiskers standing straight out as he realizes he's bitten into a hot pepper instead of his catnip toy.

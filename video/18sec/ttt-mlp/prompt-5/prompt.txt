A bright kitchen with wooden cabinets and a white tiled floor. A refrigerator stands on the left wall, and a counter with a sink runs along the back wall. Jerry, the brown mouse, tiptoes across the kitchen floor carrying a small bowl filled with white paint. Tom's regular blue milk bowl sits on the floor near the refrigerator. Jerry carefully approaches the milk bowl, looking from side to side to ensure he's not being watched. The camera follows Jerry as he gently sets down the paint bowl next to Tom's empty milk bowl.

Jerry, the brown mouse, stands next to Tom's empty blue milk bowl and a small container of white paint. Jerry lifts Tom's empty milk bowl with both hands and sets it aside, then picks up the paint bowl with his small paws. The camera remains steady as Jerry carefully pours the white paint into Tom's blue milk bowl, glancing nervously toward the doorway.

Jerry, the brown mouse, stands beside Tom's blue milk bowl, which is now filled with white paint that looks identical to milk. Jerry places the empty paint container behind the refrigerator and dusts off his hands with a satisfied expression. The camera zooms in slightly as Jerry admires his handiwork, then turns and walks toward the kitchen doorway with a mischievous smile.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A cozy living room with beige walls and a large window on the right. A green couch sits against the back wall, with a small wooden coffee table in front of it and a floor lamp in the corner. Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks out from behind a decorative cushion on the green couch, his eyes wide with anticipation. Jerry covers his mouth with both paws to suppress his laughter as he watches the doorway to the kitchen, occasionally ducking further behind the cushion.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, walks proudly through the doorway into the living room with his chest puffed out and head held high. A thick white paint mustache sits prominently above his upper lip, giving him a distinguished appearance. The camera pans slowly with Tom as he struts across the living room floor, completely unaware of the paint on his face.

A cozy living room with beige walls and a large window on the right. A green couch sits against the back wall, with a small wooden coffee table in front of it and a floor lamp in the corner. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands in the center of the living room with a proud white paint mustache above his lips, while Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks from behind the cushion on the couch. Jerry's body shakes with silent laughter as he watches Tom preening and stroking his fake mustache with one paw. The camera slowly zooms out to capture both characters in the frame, highlighting the contrast between Tom's pride and Jerry's amusement.

The sunlit cozy living room features beige wallpaper, a brown sofa against one wall, a central coffee table, warm ceiling lighting, a corner bookshelf, and various framed pictures adorning the walls. Tom, the blue-gray cat with perceptibly upturned whiskers, stands proudly with crossed arms, his tail gently swaying side-to-side as he gazes upward at his newly-hung framed photograph. The prominently displayed photograph captures Jerry, the brown mouse, in an embarrassing momentâ€”caught mid-bite with bulging cheeks and wide, surprised eyes as he consumes the fish that Tom had strategically set up as bait in the kitchen earlier.

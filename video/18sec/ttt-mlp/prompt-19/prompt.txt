A simple kitchen with white tiled walls and a wooden floor. A wooden door with a brass handle leads into the kitchen, and a small table with a piece of cheese sits in the center of the room. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands on a small stepladder next to the door, carefully attaching a small brass bell to a string above the door frame. Tom secures the bell with the final twist of string, testing that it jingles when the door moves, and then climbs down from the stepladder with a satisfied expression.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, crouches behind the refrigerator with only his eyes peeking out, watching the door intently. Tom's eyes follow the bell hanging above the door, his tail swishing slowly behind him as he settles into his hiding spot, ready to spring his trap when Jerry approaches.<end_scene>

Jerry, the brown mouse, holds the small brass bell from the kitchen door and carefully approaches Tom, the blue-gray cat, who continues to sleep soundly on the sofa. Jerry tiptoes to the end of the sofa where Tom's tail hangs over the edge, gently lifting the tail and beginning to tie the bell to its tip with a piece of string.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, freezes in place as his tail moves slightly, causing the bell to jingle loudly in the quiet room. Spike, the gray bulldog, opens one eye at the sound of the bell, his expression changing from sleepy to annoyed as he spots Tom standing near his dog bed. The camera zooms in slowly on Tom's face as his eyes widen with realization and fear, while Spike rises from his bed with a low growl, glaring at the cat who disturbed his sleep.

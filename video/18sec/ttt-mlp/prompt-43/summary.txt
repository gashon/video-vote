Inside a cozy mouse hole with wooden walls and a small, soft carpet, Jerry the brown mouse sits contentedly in his miniature armchair, his tiny paws delicately turning the pages of his book under the warm glow of a lamp positioned on a nearby table. Through the perfectly circular entrance of the mouse hole, the lower portion of Tom's face is visibleâ€”his blue-gray fur now completely sullied with dark, moist soil and scattered plant debris, while a single vibrant red flower petal clings tenaciously to his fur just below his right eye. Jerry's whiskers twitch slightly as he maintains a perfectly serene expression, his tail curled comfortably beside him on the chair cushion, completely undisturbed by whatever calamity has befallen Tom outside as he continues his peaceful reading session, his eyes tracking methodically across the tiny text on the yellowed pages.

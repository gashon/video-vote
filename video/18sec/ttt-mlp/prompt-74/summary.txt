The light blue bedroom's partially open wooden door supports a precariously balanced white ceramic bowl of milk, meticulously positioned by Jerry the brown mouse who stands on a small step stool, his tiny paws making final adjustments until the bowl stops wobbling. Tom, the blue-gray cat, enters the yellow-walled kitchen with half-closed eyes and a lazily swaying tail, completely unaware of the wooden rolling pin lying directly in his path near the staircase base. Upon stepping on the rolling pin, Tom's eyes bulge in shock as his paw slides forward, arms windmilling desperately while his body tilts backward toward the stairs, before he tumbles down in a chaotic somersault with splayed limbs and a flicking tail. The catastrophe culminates when Tom crashes into his bedroom's partially open door, violently dislodging the balanced milk bowl which upends completely over his head, drenching his fur as he sits dazed on the floor with milk forming a puddle beneath him.

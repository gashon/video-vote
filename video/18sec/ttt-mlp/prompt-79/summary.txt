The elderly lady's gray hair peeks out from beneath her pink floral shower cap, her wrinkled face transforming from peaceful relaxation to horrified surprise as her mouth forms a perfect O-shape and her bushy eyebrows shoot upward while Tom plummets through the jagged ceiling hole surrounded by plaster debris. Tom's limbs are splayed in all directions, his blue-gray fur standing on end, pupils dilated in terror, with the silver thumbtack still visibly embedded in his rear end as he descends toward the bubble-filled bathtub where three yellow rubber ducks and a loofah float among lavender-scented foam. Water erupts in a dramatic crown-shaped splash pattern, drenching the powder-blue tile walls, knocking a decorative seashell soap dish off its holder, and soaking the embroidered monogram "E.P." on the lady's white terry cloth bathrobe hanging from a brass hook on the back of the mint-green bathroom door.

Jerry, the brown mouse, meticulously places a cheese crumb on the edge of a spring-loaded cabinet door in a bright kitchen with white cabinets, wooden countertops, and sunlight filtering through a small window, testing the door's tension with his paw before hiding behind a tall salt shaker with just his eyes and ears visible above the counter. Tom, the blue-gray cat, enters with twitching whiskers, following the scent until he presses down on the baited cabinet door, unwittingly triggering the trap. The impact launches Tom violently upward, creating a cat-shaped hole in the ceiling as he soars through with a surprised expression, debris and dust scattering around his extended body and trailing tail. Tom plummets directly into a blue-tiled bathroom's water-filled bathtub, displacing a floating rubber duck and splashing water onto the floor as his expression transforms from shock to dismay upon impact with the water. Meanwhile, Jerry sits contentedly on the kitchen counter, taking small bites from a full wedge of cheese much larger than his bait, crumbs falling around him as he enjoys his meal with a satisfied expression, the sprung cabinet door still visibly open in the background.

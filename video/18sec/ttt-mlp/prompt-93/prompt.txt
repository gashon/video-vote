A cozy kitchen with cream-colored walls, wooden cabinets, and a tiled floor. A small mouse hole is visible at the bottom of the wall, with a tiny wooden door that's slightly ajar. Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges sleepily from his mouse hole, rubbing his eyes with one paw while his other paw pushes the tiny door open wider. Jerry slowly steps out of the hole, stretches his arms upward, and yawns widely as the camera captures him from a side angle.

Jerry, the brown mouse, is positioned just inside his hole, with only his head and shoulders visible as he peeks out.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, naps peacefully in a plush armchair as sunlight filters through delicate lace curtains in a cozy living room featuring beige walls and wooden flooring, while Jerry, a small brown mouse with alert ears, meticulously swaps Tom's red catnip toy with a bright green jalapeño pepper, arranging it perfectly near Tom's paws before retreating with a mischievous grin that crinkles his whiskers. Upon waking, Tom stretches his front paws—claws momentarily extending—and drowsily reaches for the green object, mistaking it for his toy, his tail twitching slightly as he brings the jalapeño toward his partially open mouth while Jerry observes from behind a porcelain floral vase with only his eyes and ears visible. Tom's expression transforms dramatically from sleepy contentment to shocked horror as the spicy pepper touches his tongue, his yellow-green eyes bulging wide, whiskers quivering violently, and ears shooting upright while his fur visibly bristles along his spine and his pupils dilate to perfect circles against his now-watering eyes.

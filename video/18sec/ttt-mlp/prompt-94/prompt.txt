A cozy living room with soft beige walls, wooden floorboards, and a few pieces of furniture scattered around. A small cushion sits on the floor near a window where sunlight streams in, creating a warm spot. Jerry, the brown mouse, is curled up on the tiny cushion with his eyes closed, sleeping peacefully. His tiny chest rises and falls slowly as he naps, completely unaware of his surroundings.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, appears from the left side of the frame, walking on his tiptoes with his body hunched low, eyes fixed on the sleeping mouse. Tom takes slow, careful steps toward Jerry, his paws barely making contact with the wooden floor as he approaches with extreme caution.

Jerry, the brown mouse, remains asleep on the tiny cushion, his whiskers twitching slightly in his sleep. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is now very close to Jerry, still hunched over and moving with deliberate slowness. Tom reaches out his paw toward Jerry but misjudges his distance and accidentally bumps a small flower pot sitting on a nearby table, causing it to wobble precariously.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A close-up view of a small table with a decorative vase and a clay flower pot with a small green plant. The pot is tilting toward the edge of the table, about to fall off. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands beside the table with his paw still outstretched, eyes widening in alarm as he watches the pot begin to tip. The flower pot slowly tips over the edge of the table and falls to the floor with a soft thud, spilling soil across the wooden floorboards.

Jerry, the brown mouse, is on the tiny cushion, disturbed by the noise and now blinking his eyes open sleepily. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands frozen in place near the toppled flower pot, his body tense and his expression showing clear dismay at having made the noise. Jerry opens his mouth in a wide yawn, stretches his tiny arms above his head, and then curls back into a ball on the cushion, immediately returning to his nap.

A small cushion sits on the floor near a window where sunlight streams in, creating a warm spot. Jerry, the brown mouse, is once again sleeping peacefully on the tiny cushion, his breathing slow and regular. Tom, the blue-gray cat, turns away from the sleeping mouse, his shoulders visibly slumped in disappointment. Tom walks slowly toward the door with his head hanging low and his tail dragging on the floor behind him, accepting his defeat as he moves away from Jerry.

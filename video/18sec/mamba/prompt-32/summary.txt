A small, cozy mouse hole in the kitchen baseboard features rounded edges and a partially open tiny wooden door, revealing glimpses of miniature furniture bathed in warm interior lighting. Jerry sits cross-legged at the entrance with the partially-eaten chocolate chip cookie resting on a miniature ceramic plate decorated with tiny blue flowers beside him, crumbs scattered around his whiskers and on his lap. The brown mouse's eyes crinkle with mischievous delight as his lips curl into a satisfied smirk, one paw covering his mouth to suppress a giggle while his other paw reaches for another morsel of the cookie, all while Tom's dejected sigh reverberates through the kitchen and the cat's shadow can be seen falling across the floor just inches from Jerry's sanctuary.

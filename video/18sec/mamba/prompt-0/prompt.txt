A bright, clean kitchen with white cabinets, a tiled floor, and a window letting in sunlight. A small blue bowl filled with white milk sits on the floor near a corner. Tom, the blue-gray cat, lies curled up on his side next to the milk bowl, eyes closed and breathing softly as he naps peacefully on the kitchen floor. Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges from his mouse hole in the baseboard, looks cautiously at the sleeping Tom, then carefully tiptoes toward the milk bowl while carrying a small green cushion that's almost his size.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, continues to sleep peacefully on his side, his chest rising and falling with each breath, completely unaware of what's happening nearby. Jerry, the brown mouse, slowly approaches the milk bowl, gently places the green cushion directly over it, completely covering the bowl from view, then steps back to admire his handiwork while glancing nervously at Tom.<end_scene>

Tom, the blue-gray cat, stretches his front paws forward as he awakens from his nap, yawning widely and blinking his eyes open. His gaze falls on what appears to be his milk bowl area, now covered by the green cushion, and his expression brightens with anticipation as he rises to a sitting position, licking his lips hungrily.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, is now fully awake and standing on all fours, his tail swishing slowly from side to side as he focuses intently on what he believes is his milk bowl beneath the cushion. With determination in his eyes, Tom leaps forward and pounces directly onto the green cushion, his weight pressing down as the floor beneath him suddenly gives way with a loud cracking sound.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A dimly lit basement with concrete walls, wooden beams across the ceiling, and various boxes and storage items scattered around. A perfect circular hole is visible in the ceiling, with splintered wood around its edges. Tom, the blue-gray cat, lies sprawled on his back in a pile of dirty laundry, his eyes spinning in circles and small stars circling above his head. The camera angle is from below, looking up at the hole in the ceiling as debris and small wood fragments continue to fall gently around the dazed Tom.

A perfect circular hole is visible in the ceiling, with splintered wood around its edges. Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains motionless in the pile of dirty laundry, his eyes now crossed and a small bump forming on his head as he tries to regain his senses. Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks his head through the hole in the ceiling, looking down at Tom with his paws covering his mouth as he giggles at the success of his prank, his small shoulders shaking with silent laughter.

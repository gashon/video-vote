The immaculately kept living room features beige walls complemented by polished wooden flooring, with a plush sofa positioned against the far wall and a single cushion placed deliberately at the room's center, illuminated by golden afternoon sunlight streaming through partially opened venetian blinds. Jerry, a small brown mouse with delicate whiskers and a pinkish tail curled around his diminutive body, lies in a tight ball on the cushion, his tiny chest rising and falling rhythmically as he sleeps, whiskers occasionally twitching with each exhale. His fur appears particularly soft in the gentle lighting, creating a warm honey-colored halo effect around his sleeping form, while dust motes dance lazily in the sunbeams that cross-section the otherwise undisturbed tranquility of the meticulously maintained living space.

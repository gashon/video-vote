A cozy living room with a beige couch against a pale blue wall. A coffee table sits in front of the couch on a patterned carpet. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is curled up on the couch, his eyes closed, his body rising and falling with deep breaths as he sleeps soundly. Jerry, the brown mouse, approaches the sleeping cat on tiptoe, holding a yellow flower with a distinctive cheese scent, his face showing concentration as he carefully extends his arm to position the flower directly beneath Tom's nose.

A cozy living room with a beige couch against a pale blue wall. A coffee table sits in front of the couch on a patterned carpet. Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains on the couch but his nose begins to twitch as he detects the cheese scent, his eyes still closed but his face showing signs of awakening. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands back slightly, watching with anticipation as Tom's eyes slowly flutter open, the cat's nose continuing to sniff the air with increasing interest as he gradually sits up.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A hallway with cream-colored walls connects the living room to the kitchen, with a wooden floor running its length. A small side table with a lamp stands against one wall. Tom, the blue-gray cat, walks slowly down the hallway with his eyes half-closed, his nose raised and sniffing the air repeatedly. The cat moves in a dreamlike state, following the cheese scent with his paws stretching forward in exaggerated steps, his tail swaying gently behind him as the camera tracks his movement toward the kitchen doorway.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A kitchen with white cabinets, a tiled floor, and a window above the sink letting in afternoon sunlight. A refrigerator stands tall against the right wall, next to a counter with a fruit bowl. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands in the kitchen doorway, his nose still twitching as he sniffs the air, his eyes now fully open but showing confusion. The camera pans upward from Tom to reveal the top of the refrigerator, where Jerry is not yet visible, while Tom takes several steps into the kitchen, looking around with growing awareness.

A kitchen with white cabinets, a tiled floor, and a window above the sink letting in afternoon sunlight. A refrigerator stands tall against the right wall, next to a counter with a fruit bowl. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands in the middle of the kitchen with his head tilted upward, his eyes widening with realization. Jerry, the brown mouse, sits atop the refrigerator surrounded by small pieces of cheese, a miniature feast spread before him as he takes a bite from a large yellow wedge, his expression showing pure enjoyment while the camera captures both characters in the frame.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The top of the refrigerator viewed from above, showing a flat surface with several pieces of cheese arranged in a circle. A small plate with cheese crumbs sits in the center. Jerry, the brown mouse, sits cross-legged amid his cheese feast, holding the fake yellow flower in one paw and a piece of cheese in the other. Jerry waves the flower teasingly over the edge of the refrigerator, looking down with a mischievous smile as Tom glares up at him from below, the cat's ears flattened against his head in annoyance while his tail swishes slowly from side to side.

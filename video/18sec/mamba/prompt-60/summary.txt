A lush garden showcases vibrant flowers in shades of red, yellow, and purple alongside emerald-green shrubs, with a meticulously laid gray stone pathway extending from the wooden kitchen door. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands completely soaked with water cascading from his whiskers, ears, and tail, creating a small puddle beneath his paws, while his fur appears matted and darkened from the drenching, and the overturned silver metal bucket with its handle pointing upward lies on the stone path just inches from his right foot. Jerry, the small brown mouse with rounded ears and a pink tail, perches atop a moss-speckled rock with both paws clutching his belly, his tiny body shaking with uncontrollable laughter as tears of mirth form at the corners of his eyes, while his mouth is wide open showing his tiny teeth, and Tom's expression transforms from wide-eyed shock to narrowed-eye fury with his whiskers twitching and paws clenching as the realization of the prank dawns on him.

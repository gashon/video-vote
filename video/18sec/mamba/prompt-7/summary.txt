Inside Jerry's mouse hole, the smooth earthen walls curve around his tiny living space where a meticulously crafted bed of cotton and fabric scraps sits beneath a miniature lamp that casts a warm, golden glow throughout the cozy dwelling. Jerry, with his brown fur slightly ruffled and whiskers twitching with delight, perches cross-legged on the edge of his bed, his tiny paws delicately holding the yellow cheese wedge with visible holes as he takes precise, eager nibbles, his cheeks occasionally bulging slightly with each bite while his eyes close momentarily in pure contentment.

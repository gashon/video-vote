A sunny garden with green grass, colorful flowers, and a stone path extends across the frame, with a wooden bench positioned beneath a leafy tree that casts intricate dappled shadows on the right side. Tom, the blue-gray cat, sits on the bench holding a fish sandwich with both paws, his whiskers twitching slightly in anticipation as he reaches for a white ceramic salt shaker with a silver top placed precisely two inches from his right thigh. Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks cautiously from behind a large terracotta flower pot with a chipped rim at the left edge of the frame, his tiny brown paws covering his mouth to suppress a giggle while his round ears perk up alertly and his tail curls slightly upward in excitement.

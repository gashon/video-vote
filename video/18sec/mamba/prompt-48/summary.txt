The bathroom features light blue tiled walls with a white porcelain sink positioned beneath a large rectangular mirror, complemented by gleaming silver faucets and organized bathroom accessoriesâ€”a toothbrush holder on the right and a drinking cup on the left. Tom, the blue-gray cat with his fur now completely normal except for his stark white face covered in paint, stands frozen in horrified disbelief on his hind legs while gripping the sink's edge with his front paws, his yellow eyes widened to their fullest extent and jaw hanging open to reveal his pink tongue and teeth. The white paint covering Tom's face has small imperfections where his paw disturbed it, creating a visible paw print across his right cheek that reveals patches of his natural fur beneath, while some paint drips slowly from his whiskers onto the sink below. Jerry watches Tom's predicament from the partially open doorway, his tiny brown body shaking with silent laughter as he covers his mouth with both paws, his beady black eyes twinkling with mischievous delight while his tail curls upward in excitement behind him.

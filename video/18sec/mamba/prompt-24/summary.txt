The beige sofa's woven fabric texture is clearly visible against the powder-blue wall, with sunlight filtering through partially-drawn curtains onto the polished wooden coffee table, while Jerry—a small brown mouse with rounded ears and a pink tail curled behind him—sits cross-legged on a slightly indented cushion, holding a miniature leather-bound book with tiny gold-leaf page edges between his delicate paws. Tom, a blue-gray tabby cat with distinctive darker stripes across his face and white-tipped paws, has meticulously placed a pristine white ceramic bowl filled to the brim with milk (creating a subtle meniscus at the edge) on the cushion approximately three inches from Jerry's right side, and now sits back on his haunches with his whiskers twitching slightly and pupils dilated in anticipation, his tail making rhythmic sweeping motions against the hardwood floor.

A cozy living room with beige walls, hardwood flooring, and a large red cushion placed centrally on a patterned rug. A small pet bed sits in the corner of the room near a window with cream curtains. Jerry, the brown mouse, is curled up asleep on Tom's red cushion, his small body rising and falling with each breath. Jerry's eyes are closed and he has a peaceful expression as he nestles comfortably in the center of the large cushion.

The red cushion is noticeably absent from its usual spot on the patterned rug. Jerry, the brown mouse, walks through the doorway on the left, his fur damp from the rain.

The red cushion is noticeably absent from its usual spot on the patterned rug. Tom, the blue-gray cat, and Jerry, the brown mouse, are both at the small pet bed in the corner. Tom sits halfway in the pet bed looking reluctant while Jerry climbs in beside him. Tom shifts to make room for Jerry, and both animals settle into the too-small pet bed, their expressions showing an uneasy truce.

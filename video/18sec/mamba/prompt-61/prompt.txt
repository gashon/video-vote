A kitchen with white tile floor and wooden counter tops stands under bright fluorescent lighting. A cookie jar sits on the edge of a wooden counter next to a sink and kitchen window. Jerry, the brown mouse, is standing on the kitchen counter, reaching his small paws into the cookie jar. Jerry slowly removes a large chocolate chip cookie from the jar, holding it carefully with both paws while looking around cautiously.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The kitchen counter extends along a white wall with cabinets above and a sink to the right. A half-empty cookie jar rests on the counter surface with its lid placed beside it. Jerry, the brown mouse, is clutching a chocolate chip cookie nearly as big as himself with both paws. Jerry walks deliberately across the counter toward the edge, glancing over his shoulder while hugging the oversized cookie to his chest.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A section of kitchen wall near the floor shows a small, round mouse hole with slightly chipped edges. The baseboards are white against light yellow wall, with a glimpse of the counter visible above. Jerry, the brown mouse, approaches the mouse hole from the right, holding a chocolate chip cookie that's nearly as large as his body. Jerry slows his pace as he nears the mouse hole, turns sideways, and carefully maneuvers the cookie through the entrance before following it inside.

The kitchen has white tile floors, wooden cabinets, and a refrigerator visible in the background. A few crumbs are scattered on the floor near a mouse hole in the baseboard. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands in the middle of the kitchen with his ears perked up and his whiskers twitching. Tom turns his head from side to side, looking around the kitchen with narrowed eyes, then walks toward the cabinets while sniffing the air suspiciously.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The inside of Jerry's mouse hole shows a cozy space with tiny furniture, including a matchbox bed and a thimble chair against earthy brown walls. A sliver of light comes through a small crack in the wall. Jerry, the brown mouse, sits comfortably in the center of his home, holding the large chocolate chip cookie on his lap. Jerry takes a big, satisfying bite of the cookie, causing several crumbs to break off and fall downward through a crack in his floor.

The kitchen floor is shown from a low angle with the mouse hole visible in the baseboard. A small pile of cookie crumbs has formed on the floor. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is standing near the mouse hole with his back to the camera. Tom feels something land on his head, reaches up with his paw to investigate, and looks upward as cookie crumbs continue to fall onto his face from a crack in the wall above.

In the sunlit kitchen with pristine white floor tiles, Jerry the brown mouse perches on the wooden counter beside an enormous wedge of yellow cheese that towers over him at twice his height, its textured surface showing tiny holes throughout and a slightly waxy rind along one edge. With delicate paws, Jerry has broken off an irregular chunk from the wedge's bottom corner, his tiny fingers leaving indentation marks in the cheese as he brings it to his mouth with eyes blissfully closed, whiskers twitching with each satisfied bite, and his small brown tail curled contentedly behind him while his round ears stand perfectly erect in undisturbed enjoyment.

<start_scene>Inside the mouse hole, there's a tiny, cozy room with miniature furniture, including a small wooden table and matchbox bed. A small shelving unit holds thimbles and other tiny objects against the earthen wall. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands beside a small refrigerator made from a matchbox, reaching inside to take out a small wedge of yellow cheese. Jerry holds the cheese carefully in both paws, examining it with satisfaction before turning toward the entrance of his home. The camera remains fixed on Jerry as he walks slowly toward the exit of the mouse hole with the cheese in his paws.<end_scene>

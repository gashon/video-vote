In the warm-toned living room with wooden floors and yellow walls, Jerry the brown mouse visibly startles at Tom's thunderous sneeze, his tiny paws losing their grip on his reading material which tumbles onto the floor of his intricately furnished mouse hole with a barely audible thud. The blue-gray cat momentarily disrupts his slumber on the nearby soft cushion, his eyes blinking drowsily three times before his head settles back down, whiskers still slightly quivering from the sneeze as his breathing pattern returns to the slow, rhythmic cadence of deep sleep, completely oblivious to both the spider that has retreated upward and Jerry's wide-eyed, startled expression as the mouse gazes down at his fallen literature.

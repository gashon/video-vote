A spacious kitchen with white and blue tiles on the floor, wooden cabinets along the walls, and a small window letting in sunlight. A cozy red cushion sits in the corner near a refrigerator. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is curled up on the red cushion with his eyes closed, his chest rising and falling steadily as he naps. Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks out from a small hole in the baseboard, his eyes fixated on a large yellow wedge of cheese sitting on the counter.

A spacious kitchen with white and blue tiles on the floor, wooden cabinets along the walls, and a small window letting in sunlight. A cozy red cushion sits in the corner near a refrigerator. Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges fully from his hole and carefully tiptoes across the tiled floor, frequently glancing at Tom, the blue-gray cat, who continues sleeping soundly on the red cushion. With determined focus, Jerry approaches the counter and stretches his arms upward, his small paws just barely reaching the edge of the countertop.

Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on the kitchen counter next to a large yellow wedge of cheese that is almost twice his size. Jerry wraps his arms around the cheese and lifts it with visible effort, his knees bending and his face showing strain as he begins to wobble under the weight, taking slow, unsteady steps toward the edge of the counter.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A cozy living room with a green carpet, beige walls adorned with framed pictures, and a brown bookshelf against the far wall. A small round table sits in the center with books stacked neatly beside a floor lamp. Jerry, the brown mouse, enters from the left side of the room, struggling to carry the large yellow cheese wedge that is making him tilt to one side as he walks. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is visible on a blue armchair on the right side of the room, curled up in a new sleeping position with his tail hanging over the edge.

Jerry, the brown mouse, wobbles across the green carpet with the heavy cheese, his small legs trembling under the weight as he approaches the center of the room.

A small round table sits in the center with books stacked neatly beside a floor lamp. The large yellow wedge of cheese flies through the air in a gentle arc toward the blue armchair where Tom, the blue-gray cat, is peacefully sleeping. The cheese descends slowly and lands perfectly on Tom's face, covering it completely while Jerry, the brown mouse, stands frozen in the center of the room with his paws covering his mouth in shock.

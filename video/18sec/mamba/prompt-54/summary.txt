The spacious living room features a tan sofa against the wall, a central coffee table, and a corner bookshelf filled with neatly arranged books, all atop hardwood flooring where dust particles dance in a beam of sunlight streaming through a nearby window. Tom, a blue-gray cat, progresses from carefully placing a small red cushion near the coffee table and selecting a thick blue book from the middle shelf, to sitting cross-legged on the cushion reading attentively, then struggling against drowsiness with drooping eyelids and nodding head, and finally succumbing to sleep lying on his back with the open book resting on his chest as shadows lengthen across the floor and the last rays of sunlight create a warm glow around his peaceful form.

A small, cozy mouse hole in the baseboard features rounded edges and a warm, dim interior illuminated by an unseen light source, with a tiny bed crafted from multicolored fabric scraps positioned in the left corner and a silver thimble filled with water resting on a matchbox table nearby. Jerry, the brown mouse with delicate pink ears and whiskers that occasionally twitch with delight, sits cross-legged on a bottlecap chair in the center of his home, holding a triangular piece of yellow Swiss cheese with both paws positioned at precisely chest level. His expressive eyes half-close in pure contentment as his tiny front teeth take methodical, precise nibbles from the cheese's pointed edge, creating minute crumbs that fall onto his light brown fur belly, while his tail curls protectively around his seated position in a perfect semicircle against the smooth dirt floor of his sanctuary.

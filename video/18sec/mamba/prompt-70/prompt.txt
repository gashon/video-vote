A spacious living room with beige walls, hardwood flooring, and a large brown sofa positioned centrally against the wall. A small coffee table sits in front of the sofa, and a lamp stands in the corner providing soft, warm lighting to the cozy space. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on the sofa holding a tiny pillow that's proportionate to his size. Jerry carefully arranges the small pillow on the sofa cushion, smoothing it out with his tiny paws and placing it just right in preparation for his nap.

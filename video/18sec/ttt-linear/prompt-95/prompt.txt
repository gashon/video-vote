A cozy living room with a light beige sofa against the wall, a wooden coffee table in the center, and a small mouse hole visible in the baseboard on the far side. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is lying stretched out on a plush cushion near the sofa, his eyes half-closed with a tired expression on his face. Jerry, the brown mouse, is standing at the edge of the wooden coffee table, looking around cautiously with his little paws at his sides. The camera follows Jerry as he slowly begins to walk across the wooden surface of the coffee table, his tiny feet making deliberate steps.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, shifts slightly on his cushion, raising his head a little higher to get a better view of what Jerry is doing, but still appears too tired to move from his comfortable spot. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands next to a chocolate chip cookie that sits on the coffee table, his small eyes widening with delight at the discovery. The camera focuses on Jerry as he walks around the cookie once, examining it from all angles with an appreciative expression.<end_scene>

Jerry, the brown mouse, stands beside the cookie, which is now several times larger than him in the close-up perspective.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, watches from his cushion, his tail swishing slowly from side to side, his expression a mixture of mild interest and laziness as he observes Jerry but makes no move to chase him. Jerry, the brown mouse, having finished his small bite of cookie, walks slowly toward the edge of the coffee table closest to the mouse hole, looking satisfied with his snack. The camera follows Jerry as he reaches the edge of the table and carefully climbs down one of the table legs to reach the floor.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, yawns widely, revealing his teeth and pink tongue, then settles back on his cushion with his eyes drooping closed, too exhausted to bother chasing after Jerry. Jerry, the brown mouse, walks across the floor at a leisurely pace, heading directly toward his mouse hole in the baseboard. The camera follows Jerry as he reaches his mouse hole, turns around once to look back at Tom, then calmly enters the hole and disappears inside.

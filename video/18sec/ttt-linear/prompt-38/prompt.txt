Tom, the blue-gray cat, is curled up on the kitchen floor near the counter, his eyes closed and his chest rising and falling gently as he sleeps. Jerry, the brown mouse, cautiously peeks his head around the corner of the counter, looking at a small wedge of yellow cheese sitting on the edge of the countertop. Jerry slowly emerges fully into view and tiptoes toward the countertop, frequently glancing at Tom to ensure he remains asleep.

The sun-drenched kitchen features alternating black and white checkered floor tiles, honey-yellow walls with subtle texture, and medium-toned wooden cabinets with brass handles, while a rectangular doorway on the right reveals a hallway with pristine white walls and polished wooden floorboards. Tom, a blue-gray cat with white paws and chest, slides uncontrollably across the slick wooden hallway floor, his soaked fur dripping water trails behind him as his arms windmill frantically in circles while his wide eyes show panic beneath furrowed brows. The metal bucket, silver with a black handle and water droplets cascading from its rim, has just fallen from Tom's head and tumbles sideways beside him as his momentum carries him directly into a white plastic laundry basket positioned against the far wall. Upon impact, Tom's body folds awkwardly as he plunges headfirst into the basket with his gray striped legs and tail sticking straight up over the edge, while small water puddles form around the overturned bucket lying on its side nearby.

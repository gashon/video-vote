In the baseboard mouse hole with light yellow walls and wooden flooring, Jerry the brown mouse enters with visible relief etched across his tiny face, his whiskers twitching slightly as he clutches his book firmly under one arm while his shoulders relax from their previously tense position. With deliberate movements, he approaches his spool table where a small candle sits unlit, pulls out his silver thimble chair with his right paw—his tiny claws making almost imperceptible scratching sounds against the metal—before settling his small brown body into the seat with a microscopic exhale, his tail curling comfortably around the base of the thimble as he reopens his leather-bound book to the exact page marked by the green leaf bookmark that peeks out from the top edge.

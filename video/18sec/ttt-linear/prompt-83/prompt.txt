A cozy living room with a soft beige carpet, a light blue wall, and a window letting in gentle sunlight. A plush red cushion rests on the floor near a small wooden table that has a simple lamp on it. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is lying curled up on the red cushion with his eyes closed and his paws tucked under his body. Jerry, the brown mouse, is sitting cross-legged on the floor about two feet away from Tom, holding an open book in his tiny paws. Tom breathes slowly and steadily while Jerry's eyes move across the pages of his book as he reads in silence.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, continues to sleep peacefully on the red cushion, his chest rising and falling with each breath. Jerry, the brown mouse, still sits cross-legged on the floor with his book, but now glances up briefly as Tom lets out a soft snore. Jerry frowns slightly at the interruption as he looks back down at his book, turning a page slowly with his small fingers.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, stretches slightly in his sleep on the red cushion, then settles back down, his whiskers twitching as he emits another gentle snore. Jerry, the brown mouse, looks up from his book with a more pronounced frown, holding his place with one finger as he watches Tom with mild annoyance, his free hand coming up to rub his ear as if the snoring is becoming bothersome.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, rolls onto his back on the red cushion, his mouth slightly open as he releases a series of soft but distinct snores.

<start_scene>A small mouse hole in the baseboard of a room with light yellow walls and wooden flooring. A tiny matchbox bed sits in one corner, and a thimble serving as a chair is positioned near a spool table with a small candle on it. Jerry, the brown mouse, enters through the round entrance of the mouse hole, still carrying his book under his arm. Jerry walks slowly to the spool table, pulls out the thimble chair with his free hand, and sits down comfortably before opening his book again to continue reading in the peaceful quiet of his home.

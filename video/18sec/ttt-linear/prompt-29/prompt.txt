A spacious kitchen with white tiled flooring and yellow walls. A wooden counter stretches along one wall with a small window above the sink letting in soft daylight. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is curled up asleep on a red cushioned chair near the kitchen table, his chest rising and falling slowly with each breath. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands by a white ceramic bowl filled with milk on the counter, carefully holding a small red bottle of hot sauce in his tiny paws. The mouse gently unscrews the cap of the hot sauce bottle and tilts it over the milk bowl, allowing several drops of the bright red liquid to fall in, while occasionally glancing nervously at the sleeping cat.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains asleep on the red cushioned chair, his tail occasionally twitching as he dreams. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands beside the white ceramic bowl of milk that is now tinged slightly pink from the hot sauce, wearing a mischievous smile on his face. The small brown mouse gently stirs the milk with a tiny spoon to distribute the hot sauce evenly throughout the liquid, then places the spoon down and backs away from the bowl while watching the sleeping cat.<end_scene>

Tom, the blue-gray cat, walks into the living room with a relaxed posture, his tail swaying gently behind him as he approaches his white ceramic bowl of milk that has been placed on the floor near the armchair. The cat bends down toward the milk bowl, unaware of its tampered contents, and lowers his face toward the liquid while the camera zooms in slightly to focus on his peaceful expression.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, is positioned over his white ceramic bowl, his cheeks bulging as he takes a large gulp of the hot sauce-infused milk, with his eyes initially closed in enjoyment. The cat's eyes suddenly widen in shock and his face turns a bright shade of red as the heat from the hot sauce registers, causing him to straighten up abruptly with his paws moving to his throat while the camera captures his expression of surprise and discomfort.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands with his fur puffed out, eyes wide and watering, and mouth opened in a silent gasp as wisps of steam emerge from between his lips. The distressed cat turns his head toward the fishbowl on the side table, his expression desperate as he spots the orange goldfish swimming peacefully inside the water-filled glass container.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, leans forward with his entire head submerged in the fishbowl, his blue-gray ears and part of his neck visible above the water's surface as air bubbles rise around his face. The orange goldfish, startled by the sudden intrusion, leaps out of the water in a high arc, its body glistening with water droplets as it hangs momentarily in mid-air with a shocked expression on its face.

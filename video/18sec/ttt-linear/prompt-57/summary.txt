Jerry, the brown mouse, sits cross-legged on a red velvet cushion atop a tan sofa, delicately turning the pages of his open book with his tiny paws, his whiskers occasionally twitching with interest as his eyes scan each line of text. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is curled into a tight ball on the hardwood floor beside the sofa, his fur rising and falling with each steady breath, one ear slightly flicking at ambient sounds while his tail remains perfectly still against his body in deep slumber. The living room's light blue walls reflect the soft afternoon light filtering through partially drawn curtains, illuminating dust particles floating above the wooden side table where a small clock ticks quietly, while the bookshelf against the far wall displays a meticulous arrangement of colorful book spines interspersed with small framed photographs and miniature potted succulents.

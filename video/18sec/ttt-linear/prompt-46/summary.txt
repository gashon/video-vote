In the beige-walled living room, Jerry's tiny brown paws lose their grip on his book, causing it to fall with a soft thud inside his mouse hole, his whiskers twitching with startled surprise as his eyes widen momentarily at the noise. Tom's blue-gray ears instantly perk up at the sound, his previously relaxed body becoming alert as he raises his head from the plush green sofa, stretches his front paws forward with extended claws that quickly retract, and then proceeds to pad deliberately across the wooden floor toward the source of the disturbance. The cat sits with perfect posture before the mouse hole, tail curled neatly around his paws while Jerry cautiously emerges just enough to reveal his nervous eyes and twitching nose, before both animals exchange respectful nods—Tom's whiskers moving subtly with his gesture while Jerry's small shoulders rise and fall with his—before returning to their separate domains with an unspoken understanding between predator and prey.

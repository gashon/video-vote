The spacious kitchen features pristine white cabinets, beige countertops, and a tiled floor, with a small "catnip" container positioned between salt and pepper shakers on the counter. Jerry, a mischievous brown mouse with bright eyes and delicate whiskers, meticulously empties the catnip behind the counter before replacing it with pepper from a small bag he clutches in his tiny paws, his tail curling slightly with excitement. After completing his prank, Jerry carefully replaces the lid on the falsely-labeled container, his whiskers twitching and mouth forming a satisfied smirk as he rubs his paws together gleefully, before descending from the counter via a hanging kitchen towel while repeatedly glancing back at his handiwork. In the sunlit living room with its floral-patterned sofa and slowly rotating ceiling fan, Tom, the unsuspecting blue-gray cat with twitching whiskers and a gently swishing tail, eagerly opens the container and deeply inhales what he believes is catnip, his expression rapidly transforming from anticipation to alarm as his eyes water and his nose twitches violently, culminating in an explosive sneeze that launches his startled body upward with limbs splayed, directly into the path of the spinning ceiling fan blades.

Inside a cozy room with wooden flooring and pale yellow walls, there's a small mouse hole at the base of the wall. A tiny wooden table with a small desk lamp sits inside the hole, casting a warm glow across the space.

Jerry turns a page of his book slowly, his eyes scanning the words as the small lamp illuminates the pages.

Across the room from the mouse hole, there's a large armchair with patterned upholstery and several cushions arranged on it. A small coffee table sits nearby on the wooden floor. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is very close to the mouse hole now, still crouched low to the ground. Tom accidentally bumps his shoulder against a fallen cushion on the floor, causing a soft thud that makes Jerry open his eyes and close his book quietly before settling back down on his cushion.

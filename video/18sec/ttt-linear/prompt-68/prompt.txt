A spacious kitchen with cream-colored walls, wooden cabinets, and a white tiled counter. A window above the sink allows sunlight to stream in, illuminating the clean surfaces and the small appliances neatly arranged in the background. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is lying on his side on the kitchen counter, eyes closed, with his head resting on his paws as he naps peacefully. His tail occasionally twitches as he breathes deeply in his slumber. A small white ceramic bowl filled with milk sits near his front paws, untouched while he sleeps.

Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges from a small hole in the baseboard, looking cautiously around the kitchen. He tiptoes carefully across the counter, carrying a small container of white paint in his tiny paws. Jerry approaches the sleeping Tom's milk bowl, glancing at the cat to ensure he remains asleep as he prepares to switch the contents.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, continues to sleep peacefully on the counter, unaware of any mischief happening nearby. Jerry, the brown mouse, carefully pours the white paint into an identical empty bowl he's brought with him, then swaps it with Tom's milk bowl, placing the paint-filled bowl exactly where the milk bowl had been. The camera slowly zooms in as Jerry steps back with a mischievous smile, admiring his handiwork before retreating toward his mouse hole.<end_scene>

Tom, the blue-gray cat, slowly awakens from his nap, stretching his front paws forward and opening his mouth in a wide yawn. He blinks sleepily, then notices the bowl in front of him, licking his lips hungrily as he gazes at what appears to be his milk bowl. Tom lowers his head and begins to lap at the liquid in the bowl, taking several slow licks of what he believes is milk.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A clean bathroom with light blue tiled walls, a porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, and a large mirror mounted above it. The bathroom is well-lit, with small decorative items visible on a shelf to the right of the sink. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands on his hind legs in front of the bathroom mirror, his front paws resting on the edge of the sink as he leans forward. His expression is neutral as he approaches the mirror, seemingly drawn by an unusual sensation in his mouth. Tom moves closer to the mirror, inspecting his reflection with growing curiosity as his eyes begin to widen slightly.

The bathroom is well-lit, with small decorative items visible on a shelf to the right of the sink. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands frozen in shock before the mirror, his eyes now completely wide and bulging. His entire mouth and whiskers are coated in bright white paint, creating a stark contrast against his blue-gray fur. Tom's paws slowly rise to touch his painted face, his expression of disbelief becoming more pronounced as he comprehends what has happened to him.

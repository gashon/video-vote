The airy kitchen transitions to a comfortable living room featuring a beige couch against light blue walls, with a coffee table, corner television, and soft illumination from a floor lamp beneath curtained windows indicating daytime. Tom, the blue-gray cat, lounges contentedly on the couch with paws behind his head and legs extended, watching television with half-lidded eyes while his tail dangles lazily over the edge, completely unaware as Jerry, the small brown mouse, strategically pushes the wooden mousetrap with cheese still attached across the floor toward Tom's vulnerable tail. Jerry meticulously positions the trap directly beneath Tom's dangling tail and gently nudges the blue-gray appendage downward toward the trigger mechanism with careful determination, resulting in the trap snapping shut on Tom's tail, causing the cat to leap upward with a howling mouth and shocked wide eyes while Jerry sits nearby, contentedly munching on the piece of cheese with evident satisfaction as he watches Tom arch his back in agony with paws reaching toward his trapped tail.

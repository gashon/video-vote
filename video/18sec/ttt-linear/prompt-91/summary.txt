Jerry, the brown mouse, stands crestfallen beside his completely flattened prized red flower—its vibrant petals now pressed pathetically against the dirt—with his tiny shoulders visibly slumped and whiskers drooping downward in perfect alignment with his sorrowful expression. His minuscule paws delicately trace the crushed petals with trembling fingers, the sunlight catching the slight moisture gathering in his wide, devastated eyes as a single leaf from the flower's broken stem detaches and spirals slowly to the ground. The surrounding garden remains ironically vibrant with untouched blooms swaying gently in the breeze, creating a stark contrast to the destroyed flower that lies flattened in a perfect outline of Tom's paw print, complete with visible toe pad impressions pressed deeply into the soft garden soil.

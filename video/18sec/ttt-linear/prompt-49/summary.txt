The cozy living room features a beige sofa against light blue walls with Tom, the blue-gray cat, sleeping peacefully while Jerry stealthily removes the goldfish bowl from a side table near the window, leaving only a folded paper in its place. In the lush garden outside, Jerry carefully positions the goldfish bowl on a flat stone and installs a tiny wooden diving board on its rim, securing it meticulously while the orange goldfish circles confusedly inside. The tranquil garden scene transitions to a stone patio bathed in warm sunlight where Jerry, now wearing miniature sunglasses, tests the water temperature with his toe while preparing to dive, completely unaware of Tom who has just arrived with an initially shocked expression that quickly transforms into anger, his eyebrows furrowing, whiskers twitching irritably, and tail beginning to twitch as he extends one paw forward in the first step toward confrontation.

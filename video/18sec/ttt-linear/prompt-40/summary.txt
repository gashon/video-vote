The kitchen floor displays a pristine black and white checkered tile pattern with the rich mahogany table legs casting subtle shadows as afternoon light filters through nearby windows, while a vintage cream-colored refrigerator with chrome handles stands against the pale yellow wall adorned with a small floral clock. Tom, the blue-gray cat with distinctive darker stripes along his back and a small nick in his left ear, trudges dejectedly away from the table with his whiskers drooping noticeably, his tail dragging in a perfect "S" curve along the polished tiles, and his normally perky ears flattened against his head as he exhales a barely audible sigh that momentarily fogs a small section of the floor beneath his downturned muzzle.

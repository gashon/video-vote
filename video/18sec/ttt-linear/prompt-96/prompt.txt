A clean kitchen with white tiled walls, a refrigerator on the left, and a counter with various appliances on the right. The floor is checkered black and white. In the center, there's a small table with a bowl of milk. Jerry, the brown mouse, is sneaking across the kitchen floor, carrying a small red bottle labeled 'Hot Sauce' in his paws. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is nowhere in sight. Jerry approaches the bowl of milk on the table, looks around cautiously, then pours the entire bottle of hot sauce into the milk, stirring it quickly with his paw to mix it thoroughly.

In the center, there's a small table with a bowl of milk that now has a slightly pinkish tint. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands beside the bowl with an empty hot sauce bottle in his paws, a mischievous smile spreading across his face. Jerry places the empty bottle behind the bowl, then scurries toward a mouse hole in the baseboard of the wall, occasionally glancing back at the doctored milk with a snicker.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A cozy living room with a blue sofa against the back wall, a coffee table in the center, and a fireplace on the right. The walls are painted a warm beige color, and a large window on the left allows sunlight to stream in. Tom, the blue-gray cat, walks into the living room from the left side of the frame, his gaze fixed on something ahead. Tom approaches the coffee table where a bowl of milk sits, unaware of any tampering, and lowers his head to drink from it.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, is bent over the bowl of milk on the coffee table, taking a large gulp with his eyes closed. From the side wall, Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks out from his mouse hole, watching Tom with anticipation, his paws covering his mouth to suppress his laughter.

The walls are painted a warm beige color, and a large window on the left allows sunlight to stream in. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands rigid with his fur puffed out, his eyes bulging wide open, and his face turning bright red. Steam begins to pour from both of Tom's ears as he slowly rises from the floor, his body stiffening from the intense heat of the hot sauce.<end_scene>

Jerry, the brown mouse, stands near his mouse hole in the wall, doubled over with his paws on his stomach. Jerry's mouth is wide open in silent laughter, tears forming at the corners of his eyes as he watches the ceiling where Tom has disappeared through a cat-shaped hole.

A spacious kitchen with yellow walls, white cabinets, and a tiled floor. A wooden table sits in the center of the room with a fruit bowl on it. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is lying on his side on the kitchen floor, eyes closed, his body rising and falling with each breath as he sleeps peacefully. Jerry, the brown mouse, is standing near Tom's head, carefully holding a large yellow wedge of cheese that is almost as big as himself. Jerry slowly and deliberately places the cheese on top of Tom's head, balancing it carefully so it doesn't fall off.

A spacious kitchen with yellow walls, white cabinets, and a tiled floor. A wooden table sits in the center of the room with a fruit bowl on it. Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains asleep on the kitchen floor with the large yellow wedge of cheese now balanced precariously on his head. Jerry, the brown mouse, backs away from Tom with a mischievous grin on his face, his small paws covering his mouth. Jerry quietly moves away from Tom's sleeping form, his shoulders shaking slightly as he suppresses his giggles, while the cheese wobbles slightly but stays balanced on Tom's head.

A spacious kitchen with yellow walls, white cabinets, and a tiled floor. A wooden table sits in the center of the room with a fruit bowl on it. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is beginning to stir from his sleep, his eyes slowly opening with a confused expression as he senses something on his head. The large yellow wedge of cheese teeters on Tom's head as he moves, finally falling in front of his face where he can see it. Tom blinks in surprise at the cheese, then sniffs it curiously, his nose twitching as he follows the lingering scent trail that leads out of the kitchen.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A wooden staircase with a beige wall beside it and a carpeted floor. The stairs lead upward, with a window visible halfway up casting soft light onto the steps. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is walking up the stairs on all fours, his nose to the ground as he follows the cheese scent trail. The large yellow wedge of cheese is held in Tom's paw as he ascends the staircase. Tom pauses briefly on a step, lifting his head to sniff the air, then continues his methodical climb toward the upper floor, the camera following his steady progress up the stairs.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A bathroom with light blue tiled walls, a white bathtub on the right, and a sink on the left. A small puddle of clear soap is visible on the tiled floor in the center of the room. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands at the bathroom doorway, the large yellow wedge of cheese still in his paw as he looks around the room with curiosity. Tom steps forward into the bathroom, his eyes fixed on the cheese in his paw, unaware of the soap puddle directly in his path. The camera remains stationary as Tom's foot makes contact with the slippery soap, causing his leg to slide forward unexpectedly.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A bathroom with light blue tiled walls, a white bathtub filled with water on the right, and a sink on the left. The floor has wet spots and soap suds scattered across the tiles. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is sliding uncontrollably across the bathroom floor, his arms windmilling as he tries to regain his balance, the cheese flying from his paw. Tom's body tilts backward as he continues to slide toward the bathtub, his expression changing from surprise to alarm. The camera remains fixed as Tom slides completely into the bathtub with a significant splash that sends water over the edges, while the cheese lands safely on the bathroom counter.

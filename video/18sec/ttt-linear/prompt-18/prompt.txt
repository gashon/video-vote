A spacious kitchen with white walls, a tile floor, and wooden cabinets. A refrigerator stands on the left side while a counter with a few appliances lines the right wall. Tom, the blue-gray cat, kneels on the kitchen floor, carefully placing a simple wooden board trap with cheese as bait near the center of the room. His paws delicately position the trap while he looks down with concentration, his whiskers twitching slightly as he arranges the mechanism. The camera captures Tom from a side angle as he methodically sets up the trap, making small adjustments to ensure it will spring properly when triggered.

A spacious kitchen with white walls, a tile floor, and wooden cabinets. A refrigerator stands on the left side while a counter with a few appliances lines the right wall. Tom, the blue-gray cat, crouches behind the refrigerator, his body partially hidden while his face peeks out with a mischievous expression. His paws are placed against the refrigerator's side as he steadies himself in his hiding position. The camera pans slightly to show Tom snickering quietly as he watches the trap from his concealed position, his shoulders shaking gently with each silent laugh.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The kitchen floor extends across the scene with the wooden board trap prominently displayed in the center, baited with a piece of yellow cheese. A refrigerator edge is visible on the left side of the frame. Jerry, the brown mouse, approaches the trap cautiously from the right, his whiskers twitching as he examines the setup. The small mouse moves slowly toward the cheese, pausing briefly to look at the trap mechanism with a thoughtful expression. The camera remains still as Jerry cleverly reaches around the trigger, gently lifting the cheese without setting off the trap.

The kitchen floor extends across the scene with the wooden board trap now empty in the center. A refrigerator edge is visible on the left side of the frame. Jerry, the brown mouse, holds the cheese in both paws as he stands a few inches away from the disarmed trap, looking pleased with himself. The cheese is almost as big as Jerry himself, forcing him to hold it with both paws against his chest. The camera follows as Jerry turns and walks deliberately toward a small mousehole visible in the lower right corner of the scene, moving at a steady pace while carrying his prize.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A cozy mouse hole interior with rounded earthen walls, a tiny wooden table in the center, and small furniture pieces scattered around. A small window cut into the wall lets in a beam of light that illuminates the center of the room. Jerry, the brown mouse, sits at the wooden table with the large piece of cheese placed before him, his eyes wide with delight. The camera zooms in slightly as Jerry rubs his paws together in anticipation, then takes a small bite of the cheese, his expression changing to one of pure satisfaction as he chews slowly.

A spacious kitchen with white walls, a tile floor, and wooden cabinets. A refrigerator stands on the left side while a counter with a few appliances lines the right wall. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands facing a wall near the refrigerator, his shoulders slumped in defeat and frustration. His blue-gray paws are clenched at his sides, and his tail droops limply behind him. The camera holds steady as Tom slowly raises his head and then deliberately bangs it against the wall, creating a dull thud sound while his body vibrates slightly from the impact.

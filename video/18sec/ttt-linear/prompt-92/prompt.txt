A kitchen with white walls, cream-colored countertops, and wooden cabinets. A refrigerator stands on the left, and a small round table is placed near the right corner of the room. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on the countertop near a large wedge of yellow cheese. Jerry reaches out with both paws and carefully lifts the cheese wedge, which is almost as big as he is. Jerry holds the cheese close to his chest, looking pleased with his prize as he takes a small step backward.

Jerry, the brown mouse, is holding a wedge of yellow cheese in his paws while Tom, the blue-gray cat, appears at the entrance to the kitchen, his ears perked up. Jerry turns his head slowly toward Tom, his eyes widening as he clutches the cheese more tightly. The camera pans slightly to show the distance between them and a small mouse hole visible at the bottom of the wall.

Jerry, the brown mouse, is moving toward a small mouse hole in the baseboard while carrying a wedge of yellow cheese. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is a few feet away, his paw extended toward Jerry. Jerry reaches the mouse hole and carefully maneuvers the cheese inside, then slips in after it as Tom's paw lands where Jerry was just standing.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The inside of a mouse tunnel with earthy brown walls and a dirt floor. A few small roots dangle from the ceiling, and a soft light shines from an opening ahead. Jerry, the brown mouse, is walking through the tunnel carrying his wedge of cheese. Jerry moves deliberately through the tunnel, navigating around the hanging roots while keeping a firm grip on his cheese. The camera follows Jerry from behind as he approaches the light at the end of the tunnel.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A sunny garden with green grass, colorful flowers, and a wooden fence in the background. A large tree casts dappled shade on the ground near a stone path. Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges from a small hole at the base of a tree, still carrying his wedge of cheese. Jerry looks around cautiously, then walks a few steps into the garden before sitting down under the shade of the tree. The camera pulls back slightly to reveal a sleeping gray bulldog nearby, though Jerry hasn't noticed him yet.<end_scene>

Jerry, the brown mouse, is sitting in the grass with his cheese wedge, directly beneath a large gray bulldog who was sleeping but is now opening one eye. Jerry takes a small bite of his cheese with a satisfied expression, completely unaware of the danger above him. The camera angle widens to show the bulldog fully awakening, raising his head and letting out a low, hungry growl as he spots both Jerry and the cheese below him.

A cozy living room with beige walls, a wooden floor, and a comfortable sofa against the wall. A small coffee table sits in the center of the room with a few magazines on it. Jerry, the brown mouse, sits on the coffee table with a large chocolate chip cookie between his paws. Jerry slowly brings the cookie to his mouth and takes a small bite, leaving crumbs falling onto the table surface as he chews contentedly.

Jerry, the brown mouse, sits on the coffee table with a half-eaten chocolate chip cookie between his paws. Jerry continues to nibble on the cookie, dropping more crumbs onto the table surface. The crumbs scattered around Jerry begin to attract several tiny black ants that slowly march toward the tasty morsels.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A kitchen with white tiled walls, black and white checkered floor, and wooden cabinets lining the walls. A refrigerator stands in the corner next to a stove, and sunlight streams in through a small window above the sink. Jerry, the brown mouse, tiptoes across the checkered floor, his small body casting a shadow as he moves. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is curled up in a wicker basket by the refrigerator, sleeping peacefully with soft snores coming from his relaxed form. Jerry pauses to look at Tom, then continues walking slowly across the kitchen floor toward the doorway.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A hallway with light yellow walls connects the kitchen to the living room, with framed pictures hanging on one side and a small side table against the opposite wall. Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges from the kitchen doorway and walks carefully along the baseboard of the hallway. Tom, the blue-gray cat, appears at the kitchen doorway, his eyes half-open as he stretches and yawns. Tom notices Jerry walking along the hallway and begins to follow the mouse at a slow, curious pace rather than pouncing.<end_scene>

Jerry, the brown mouse, walks toward the coffee table with a satisfied expression on his face. Tom, the blue-gray cat, follows behind Jerry at a measured pace, his whiskers twitching as he observes the mouse's behavior. Jerry approaches the coffee table and stops suddenly, looking confused at the now clean tabletop where no cookie crumbs remain.

Jerry, the brown mouse, stands by the coffee table with a bewildered expression on his face. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands behind Jerry with a suspicious look in his eyes. A line of tiny black ants marches away from the table carrying the last few cookie crumbs with them. Jerry points at the departing ants, while Tom looks from the ants to Jerry with a confused expression, unable to find evidence of whatever snack he thought Jerry had been eating.

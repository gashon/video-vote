A clean kitchen with white walls, a refrigerator in the corner, and tiled floor in beige and white. A small wooden table sits in the middle, and cabinets line the walls. Tom, the blue-gray cat, holds a small wooden mousetrap in his paws, carefully placing a piece of yellow cheese on the metal trigger. Tom places the loaded mousetrap behind the refrigerator, his tail slowly swaying from side to side as he positions it perfectly on the floor.

A comfortable armchair sits in the corner, and a small table with a white ceramic bowl of milk is placed near the center. Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks from behind the armchair, his small ears perked up and beady eyes fixed on Tom's milk bowl. Jerry cautiously approaches the milk bowl, looking over his shoulder before reaching beneath his body to retrieve the wooden mousetrap he has been carrying.

A comfortable armchair sits in the corner, and a small table with what appears to be a white ceramic bowl is placed near the center. Tom, the blue-gray cat, enters from the left side of the frame, walking casually toward the small table with his tail swaying gently behind him. Tom approaches the table and bends down toward what he believes is his milk bowl, his whiskers extending forward and his eyes half-closed in anticipation.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, has his nose caught in the mousetrap, his eyes wide with surprise and pain. The mousetrap remains firmly attached to Tom's nose as he straightens up, his paws reaching toward his face while Jerry, the brown mouse, watches from behind the armchair with a satisfied smile.

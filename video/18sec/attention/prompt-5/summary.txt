The cozy living room features beige carpeting, a large brown sofa against a cream-colored wall, a coffee table, and a lamp on a side table casting soft lighting throughout the space. Tom, the blue-gray cat with alert whiskers and narrowed eyes, has lifted the sofa cushion with his left paw, revealing the hidden yellow cheese underneath while his tail swishes slightly behind him in anticipation. Jerry, the small brown mouse with wide, anxious eyes and trembling whiskers, stands a short distance away on his hind legs with his tiny paws clasped together nervously, his brown fur slightly ruffled and his small ears perked up as he watches Tom discover the cheese hiding spot.

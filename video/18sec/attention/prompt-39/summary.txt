A vibrant garden with green grass showcases a stone pathway where Jerry, the brown mouse, stands with his whiskers quivering and tiny paws frozen mid-step, his chestnut fur slightly ruffled by the gentle breeze while his black eyes widen to perfect circles upon spotting danger. The large terra cotta flower pot, chipped slightly on its rim and bearing intricate leaf patterns along its side, holds five blooming red geraniums with yellow centers, their petals casting delicate shadows on the surrounding stones. Tom's blue-gray face peeks from behind the pot with his right ear slightly bent, his emerald eyes narrowed with anticipation, and his white-tipped whiskers framing a wide, toothy grin that reveals his small pink tongue just visible between his teeth, while his left paw with extended claws grips the edge of the pot, leaving tiny scratch marks on the clay surface.

The wooden floor of the living room extends to a small, semicircular mouse hole carved into the beige baseboard, with tiny cracks visible around its edges. Jerry, the small brown mouse with rounded ears and a pink tail, walks triumphantly away from the camera, his tiny feet taking deliberate steps as he balances the disproportionately large triangular slice of bright yellow cheese above his head with both paws, the cheese's textured surface glistening slightly in the room's warm lighting. A satisfied smile spreads across Jerry's face, revealing his tiny front teeth, while his long pink tail sways rhythmically from side to side behind him, occasionally twitching with excitement as he approaches the safety of his mouse hole, leaving behind barely visible paw prints on the polished wooden floorboards.

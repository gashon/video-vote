The sunlight streams through a window above the sink, illuminating the clean countertops and polished surfaces. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands by the kitchen counter with a yellow sponge in one paw and a small paint brush in the other paw. Tom looks from side to side cautiously, ensuring no one is watching as he holds the items. With deliberate movements, Tom dips the brush into a small container of yellow paint and begins applying it to the sponge, carefully coating each side to make it resemble cheese.

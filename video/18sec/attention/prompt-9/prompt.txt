A spacious living room with a polished wooden table in the center, surrounded by comfortable furniture. A warm lamp sits in the corner, casting a soft glow across the room. Jerry, the brown mouse, sits comfortably on the wooden table, holding an open book in his tiny paws.

Jerry, the brown mouse, continues to sit on the wooden table, engrossed in his book, occasionally turning a page with careful movements. Tom, the blue-gray cat, appears from behind a nearby sofa, his body low to the ground as he slowly approaches the table where Jerry sits. Tom moves with deliberate stealth, placing each paw carefully on the floor, his eyes fixed on the unsuspecting Jerry who remains focused on his book.

Jerry, the brown mouse, remains seated on the table, turning a page in his book, completely unaware of any potential danger nearby. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is now very close to the table, his whiskers twitching as he slowly raises himself up to peer over the edge at Jerry. Tom attempts to position himself for a surprise pounce, extending one paw toward the table leg while maintaining his focus on Jerry.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A close-up view of the wooden table surface with the book Jerry was reading positioned near the edge. The polished wood grain is visible, reflecting some of the room's warm lighting.

Jerry, the brown mouse, watches calmly as his book slides completely off the table edge, his expression showing mild curiosity rather than concern. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands frozen beside the table, his eyes widening as he watches the book fall from the table in his direction. The book descends through the air toward the floor where Tom's tail is positioned, the camera following its downward trajectory.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The floor area beneath the wooden table, with the table legs visible from below and soft carpet covering the floor. The open book lies flat on the carpet, its pages spread open facing downward. Tom, the blue-gray cat, yelps silently with his mouth open wide in a pained expression, his tail trapped firmly under the fallen book. Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks over the edge of the table, observing the scene below with a small smile before returning to his seated position to continue reading without his book. Tom gingerly pulls his tail free from under the book and backs away slowly, nursing his sore tail with both paws while looking up at the table with a defeated expression.

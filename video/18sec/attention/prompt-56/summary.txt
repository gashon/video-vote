Jerry, a brown mouse with delicate whiskers and tiny paws, sits contentedly on the middle shelf of a tall wooden bookcase against a beige wall, his small back pressed against leather-bound tomes as he resumes reading from an open book held in one paw while his other paw rests on his slightly distended belly that suggests recent satisfaction. His expressive eyes occasionally drift downward toward the floor where cheese once lay, a subtle smile playing across his face as the warm, amber glow from a nearby table lamp highlights the glossy spines of surrounding books and casts gentle shadows across his fur, creating a peaceful tableau against the polished wooden floorboards that stretch across the cozy, quiet room.

Jerry, the small brown mouse with rounded ears and a pink nose, dozes on the sun-drenched wooden windowsill as his oversized hardcover book slips from his tiny paws and plummets downward, performing a perfect end-over-end tumble before landing with a soft "thud" directly on Tom's head, causing the blue-gray cat's whiskers to twitch involuntarily and his right ear to flatten momentarily against his skull. Tom's yellow-green eyes snap open with a mixture of surprise and irritation, his pupils contracting to slits in the sunlight as he glances upward at the leather-bound volume perched atop his head, then shifts his gaze toward Jerry who sits frozen with both paws covering his mouth, tiny fingers splayed, and his brown tail curled anxiously around his feet while sunlight catches the dust particles floating between them in the warm beige-walled room.

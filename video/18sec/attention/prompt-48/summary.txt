The bathroom features light blue tiled walls, a white porcelain sink with gleaming silver faucets, and a large rectangular mirror mounted precisely above it, flanked by a toothbrush holder on the right and a drinking cup on the left side of the basin. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands frozen in absolute horror on his hind legs with his front paws gripping the sink's edge so tightly his claws slightly extend, his yellow eyes bulging dramatically and jaw hanging completely slack as he confronts his reflection showing his entire face coated in thick white paint, with subtle drips forming at his chin. Jerry, the small brown mouse with oversized ears, is partially visible around the bathroom door

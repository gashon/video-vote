A sunny garden features lush green grass, vibrant multi-colored flowers (predominantly purples and yellows), and a weathered wooden fence with visible knots and slightly peeling brown paint in the background. A majestic oak tree with thick, gnarled branches casts intricate dappled shadows across the stone path made of irregularly shaped gray flagstones, while Jerry, a small brown mouse with large round ears and a pink nose, sits cross-legged in a patch of clover, completely oblivious to his surroundings as he delicately holds a triangular wedge of Swiss cheese (distinguished by its pale yellow color and characteristic holes) between his tiny paws. Directly above Jerry looms a massive gray bulldog with loose jowls, a spiked red collar, and wrinkled forehead who has just awakened from his nap—his left eye opening first followed by his right, bloodshot with visible veins—as he raises his broad head approximately eight inches off the ground while emitting a rumbling growl that causes his upper lip to curl slightly, revealing yellowed canine teeth as he fixates hungrily on both the unsuspecting mouse and the aromatic cheese below.

A kitchen with a checkered tile floor, light green walls, and wooden cabinets. A window above the sink lets in soft daylight, illuminating the room. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is curled up on a round cushion near the kitchen counter, his eyes closed and his chest rising and falling steadily as he naps. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands beside a large white ceramic bowl filled with milk on the counter, looking cautiously at the sleeping cat. Jerry reaches into his pocket, pulls out a small chisel-like tool, and begins to carefully chip away at the side of the ceramic bowl, creating a tiny hole while glancing nervously at Tom.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains asleep on his round cushion near the kitchen counter, his body relaxed and unaware. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands next to the white ceramic milk bowl on the counter, looking pleased as a small trickle of milk begins to drip through the hole he has created. The white milk slowly flows down the side of the counter, forming a small puddle that gradually expands toward the sleeping Tom, while Jerry watches with anticipation, his hands clasped together.

A kitchen with a checkered tile floor, light green walls, and wooden cabinets. A window above the sink lets in soft daylight, illuminating the room. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is lying on his round cushion with his head positioned directly below the counter edge. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands at the edge of the counter, peering down as drops of white milk fall from the damaged bowl onto Tom's face. The camera focuses on Tom's face as his whiskers twitch when the first drops of cold milk land on his nose and forehead, his eyes beginning to flutter open with a confused expression forming.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A kitchen with checkered tile floor transitions to show more of the space, including a doorway leading to the living room. The camera pans to follow the action as the characters move. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is now fully awake, standing on all fours with his fur slightly damp around his face and an angry expression as he looks up at the counter. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands at the edge of the kitchen counter with a mischievous smile, waving tauntingly at Tom before turning toward the living room doorway. Tom rises up on his hind legs, reaching with his front paws toward Jerry as the mouse begins to move away, while milk continues to drip from the damaged bowl in the background.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A living room with a beige carpet, floral-patterned wallpaper, and a brick fireplace on the far wall. A comfortable-looking sofa sits against one wall, and a small wooden table is placed near the center of the room. Tom, the blue-gray cat, walks into the living room from the kitchen doorway, his eyes narrowed and focused on Jerry who is several feet ahead of him. Jerry, the brown mouse, walks across the living room carpet toward the opposite wall where a small, round mouse hole is visible in the baseboard, glancing back over his shoulder at Tom who follows him determinedly. The camera pans slowly to follow both characters as they move across the living room, with Jerry increasing his pace slightly as he approaches his mouse hole.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A close-up view of a beige wall with a small, perfectly round mouse hole in the baseboard. The edge of the living room carpet is visible at the bottom of the frame. Jerry, the brown mouse, reaches his mouse hole and quickly slips inside, disappearing from view with only his smiling face briefly visible in the darkness of the hole. Tom, the blue-gray cat, approaches the mouse hole with determination, lowering his head and accelerating slightly toward the opening, not realizing it's too small for him. The camera remains stationary as Tom collides face-first with the wall around the mouse hole, his body compressing comically upon impact before he slides down to sit dazed on the floor, stars circling above his head.

A bright kitchen with white cabinets, a tiled floor, and a wooden countertop. A refrigerator stands in the corner, and sunlight streams through a small window. Jerry, the brown mouse, holds a small crumb of cheese in his paws as he carefully places it on the edge of a slightly ajar lower cabinet door that appears to be spring-loaded. The mouse gently sets the cheese crumb down with deliberate precision, testing the cabinet door's tension with his paw to ensure it's properly set up. The camera focuses on Jerry's careful movements as he positions the bait.

A bright kitchen with white cabinets, a tiled floor, and a wooden countertop. A refrigerator stands in the corner, and sunlight streams through a small window. Jerry, the brown mouse, moves away from the baited cabinet door and walks toward a tall salt shaker on the counter. He positions himself behind the cylindrical salt shaker, peeking out with just his eyes and ears visible above the counter's edge. The camera widens slightly to show both the hidden mouse and the cheese crumb on the cabinet door in the same frame, with Jerry watching intently as his trap is now set.

A bright kitchen with white cabinets, a tiled floor, and a wooden countertop. A refrigerator stands in the corner, and sunlight streams through a small window. Tom, the blue-gray cat, walks into the kitchen with his nose in the air, following the scent of cheese. He approaches the slightly open cabinet door where the cheese crumb sits, his whiskers twitching as he leans forward to investigate the tiny morsel. The camera captures Tom's paw as it slowly presses down on the cabinet door, applying weight to the spring-loaded mechanism while Jerry watches from his hiding spot.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The kitchen ceiling with a cat-shaped hole in it, plaster and debris falling. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is mid-air, his body extended vertically as he soars upward through the ceiling with a surprised expression on his face. Tom's momentum carries him upward through the jagged hole in the ceiling, his tail trailing behind him as debris and dust scatter in the air around him. The camera tilts upward, following Tom's trajectory through the ceiling into the room above.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A bathroom with blue-tiled walls, a white porcelain bathtub filled with water, and a small window with flowered curtains. A rubber duck floats on the water's surface. Tom, the blue-gray cat, descends from above, his arms and legs splayed outward as he falls toward the filled bathtub with a shocked expression on his face. Tom plunges into the bathtub with a substantial splash, sending water over the edges and onto the tiled floor as the rubber duck is displaced. The camera captures the moment of impact as Tom's expression changes from shock to dismay upon contact with the water.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A bright kitchen with white cabinets, a tiled floor, and a wooden countertop. A refrigerator stands in the corner, and sunlight streams through a small window. Jerry, the brown mouse, sits on the kitchen counter with a full wedge of cheese much larger than the crumb he used as bait. He holds the cheese wedge with both paws, taking a small bite and chewing contentedly. The camera zooms in slightly on Jerry's satisfied expression as he enjoys his cheese, with small crumbs falling onto the counter while the cabinet door that launched Tom remains visibly sprung open in the background.

A spacious kitchen with beige walls, white cabinets, and a tiled floor. A wooden table sits in the center with a plate of cookies on it. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is seated at the table with his back turned, seemingly distracted by something in the opposite direction. Jerry, the brown mouse, is quietly approaching the plate of cookies from the edge of the table, his tiny paws tiptoeing as he moves toward the treats. The camera is positioned to show both characters in profile as Jerry cautiously advances toward Tom's plate of cookies.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains seated at the table with his back turned, unaware of what's happening behind him. Jerry, the brown mouse, is now at the plate, carefully lifting a chocolate chip cookie that's nearly as large as he is. Jerry gently removes the cookie from the plate, holding it with both paws as he begins to move backward toward the edge of the table.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, is still at the table but now slowly turning his head toward the plate of cookies, a confused expression forming on his face. Jerry, the brown mouse, is at the edge of the table, beginning his descent to the floor with the large cookie in his paws, leaving a trail of crumbs behind him. The camera follows Jerry as he carefully slides down the table leg with one paw, while balancing the cookie with the other.

Jerry, the brown mouse, is walking across the kitchen floor toward the mouse hole, holding the large cookie in front of him and leaving a visible trail of crumbs on the floor. The camera pans slowly, following Jerry's deliberate journey across the floor as he approaches his home, occasionally glancing back toward the table where Tom sits.<end_scene>

<start_scene>Inside Jerry's mouse hole, there's a cozy bedroom with miniature furniture, soft lighting from a tiny lamp, and colorful fabric scraps serving as decorative rugs. The walls are made of exposed brick, giving the space a warm, rustic feel. Jerry, the brown mouse, is squeezing through the entrance of his mouse hole, carefully maneuvering the large cookie through the small opening. The camera is positioned inside the mouse hole, capturing Jerry's effort as he pushes the cookie inside first, then follows it through the circular entrance.

Jerry, the brown mouse, is sitting on his tiny bed made of a matchbox with cotton padding, holding the cookie on his lap with a satisfied smile. Tom's gray-blue paw suddenly extends through the mouse hole entrance, stretching toward Jerry with fingers spread, ready to grab. The camera zooms out slightly to show both Jerry's surprised expression and Tom's angry paw reaching in from outside the mouse hole.

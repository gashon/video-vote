A spacious kitchen with white tile flooring, wooden cabinets, and a small round table in the center. Sunlight streams through a window, illuminating the countertops and appliances. Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks cautiously from behind a cookie jar, holding a small paint brush and a tiny can of white paint. He glances toward Tom, the blue-gray cat, who is curled up asleep on a red cushion near the refrigerator. Jerry quietly creeps across the counter toward a white ceramic bowl filled with milk that sits a few inches from Tom's cushion.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, sleeps peacefully on a red cushion near the refrigerator, his chest rising and falling with each breath. Jerry, the brown mouse, approaches Tom's milk bowl, carefully sets down his paint can, and gently tips the bowl to pour the milk into a nearby plant pot, maintaining a watchful eye on the sleeping cat.

Jerry, the brown mouse, stands beside the now-empty milk bowl with the paint brush in his paw and the can of white paint beside him. He dips the brush into the paint and proceeds to fill Tom's bowl with the thick white liquid, occasionally looking over at Tom, the blue-gray cat, who stirs slightly on his red cushion but remains asleep.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A sunny garden with lush green grass, colorful flower beds, and a stone path winding through the center. A small birdbath stands near a maple tree, casting dappled shadows on the ground. Tom, the blue-gray cat, awakens from his nap, stretches his front paws forward, and yawns widely, revealing his pink tongue. His eyes suddenly widen as he notices his thirst, and he turns his head toward where his milk bowl should be, but sees it is no longer in the kitchen.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, walks toward his milk bowl which has been placed conspicuously on a flat garden stone. A small yellow bird perches on a nearby branch, watching with curiosity as Tom approaches the bowl. Tom leans down toward the bowl, his tail swishing gently from side to side in anticipation.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, eagerly laps at the white liquid in his bowl while the yellow bird's eyes grow wide with horror. As Tom raises his head from the bowl, his mouth and whiskers are completely coated in white paint, and his expression shifts from satisfaction to confusion as he notices the bird's reaction and the strange texture on his face.

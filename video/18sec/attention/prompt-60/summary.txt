In the sun-drenched kitchen with white countertops and pale yellow walls, Tom the blue-gray cat narrows his yellow-green eyes suspiciously while his striped tail swishes methodically from side to side, creating slight ripples in his fur as he alternates his gaze between the empty ceramic plate (which contains only a few scattered cookie crumbs) and Jerry the mouse. Meanwhile, Jerry stands on his hind legs by the stainless steel sink, his brown fur slightly damp at the edges, gripping a thimble-sized metal cup between his tiny pink-padded paws as he takes deliberate sips of water, his beady black eyes darting sideways toward Tom while his whiskers twitch with the effort of maintaining an innocent, wide-eyed expression despite the barely perceptible chocolate smudge at the corner of his mouth.

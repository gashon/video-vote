The living room features beige wallpaper, a brown sofa against the wall, and a small coffee table centrally positioned, with a distinctive mouse hole visible in the left baseboard. Tom, a blue-gray cat with white paws and chest, sits cross-legged on the hardwood floor beside the coffee table, holding a multi-layered sandwich with lettuce edges peeking out between wheat bread slices, his whiskers twitching slightly as he prepares to eat. Tom's triangular ears perk up as he takes a substantial bite from the corner of the sandwich, his expression transforming from anticipatory satisfaction to bewildered confusion—eyebrows raising and pupils dilating—as he chews slowly and realizes something crucial is missing from his meal. The ambient afternoon light streaming through partially drawn curtains casts subtle shadows across Tom's fur as he pauses mid-chew, a few breadcrumbs falling unnoticed onto his lap while his tail begins to twitch irritably against the floor.

The living room ceiling displays a perfectly cat-shaped hole through which golden sunlight streams downward, illuminating floating particles of white plaster dust that slowly descend onto the polished hardwood floor and blue sofa below. Jerry, the small brown mouse with rounded ears and a pink tail, stands precariously on his hind legs near his semicircular mouse hole in the beige wall, his tiny paws clutching his rotund belly as his mouth stretches into an exaggerated open-mouthed smile revealing tiny teeth, with crystalline tears of mirth forming at the corners of his tightly squinted eyes. The porcelain milk bowl on the coffee table is completely empty save for a few pink droplets around its rim and a small puddle of pinkish liquid on the table's surface, while the discarded red hot sauce bottle lies on its side partially hidden beneath the table's edge.

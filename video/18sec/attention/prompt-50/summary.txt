The meticulously maintained living room features light brown walls with subtle texture, a plush blue couch with three slightly indented cushions, and a rectangular wooden coffee table with visible grain patterns and slightly worn corners. Tom, the blue-gray cat with distinctive darker stripes on his tail and pointed ears that twitch occasionally, reclines with his back against the right armrest of the couch, his newspaper held at precisely eye level with tiny black text columns visible, while his left hind paw dangles slightly off the edge and his whiskers occasionally quiver as he breathes. Jerry, the brown mouse with a cream-colored underbelly and pink inner ears, emerges from his perfectly circular mouse hole with chipped edges in the baseboard, his tiny whiskers vibrating with each sniff, beady black eyes darting nervously, and minuscule clawed paws leaving imperceptible marks on the polished wooden floor as he approaches the Swiss cheese with its characteristic holes on the coffee table.

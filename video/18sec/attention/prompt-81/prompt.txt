A spacious kitchen with white tiled floors and yellow walls. A large refrigerator stands against the wall, with wooden cabinets and a sink visible to the right. Tom, the blue-gray cat, carefully balances a small bowl filled with milk on top of the slightly ajar refrigerator door. He positions the bowl precisely, ensuring it will fall when the door is opened fully. Tom steps back, admires his setup, then walks toward the kitchen doorway while occasionally glancing back at his trap.

A spacious kitchen with white tiled floors and yellow walls. A large refrigerator stands against the wall, with wooden cabinets and a sink visible to the right. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is now crouched behind the kitchen doorway, with only his eyes and the top of his head visible as he peeks into the kitchen. His tail swishes slowly from side to side as he watches the refrigerator with anticipation. The camera pans slightly to show both Tom's hiding position and the refrigerator with the precariously balanced milk bowl in the same frame.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A cozy living room with a beige carpet and light blue walls. A small mouse hole is visible in the baseboard along the wall, with a tiny table lamp and armchair nearby. Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges halfway from his mouse hole, looking cautiously left and right before stepping fully into the living room. Jerry holds a small horseshoe magnet in his paws, its red ends gleaming as he walks slowly across the carpet. The camera follows Jerry as he moves away from his mouse hole, unaware of any danger ahead.

Jerry, the brown mouse, walks across the carpet holding the red horseshoe magnet, approaching the doorway that leads to the kitchen. The magnet in Jerry's paws begins to pull him slightly forward as it reacts to something metal ahead. The camera remains stationary, showing Jerry's puzzled expression as he tries to maintain his balance while being gently tugged toward the kitchen.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The kitchen with white tiled floors and yellow walls, showing the refrigerator on the left and the doorway on the right. Jerry, the brown mouse, enters from the doorway, still holding the horseshoe magnet which is now strongly pulling him toward the refrigerator. Tom, the blue-gray cat, follows a few steps behind Jerry, his paws raised slightly as he prepares to pounce. The magnet's pull causes the refrigerator door to swing open slowly but steadily as Jerry approaches, while Tom creeps closer with a mischievous smile.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A close-up view of the kitchen, focusing on the refrigerator with its door now fully open. The bowl of milk that was balanced on top begins to tilt forward precariously. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands directly beneath the tilting bowl, looking up with wide eyes and a shocked expression as he realizes his predicament. The bowl of milk tips over completely and its contents pour downward, splashing directly onto Tom's face and upper body while Jerry, the brown mouse, stands safely to the side with his magnet.

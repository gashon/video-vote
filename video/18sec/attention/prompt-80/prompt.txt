A spotless kitchen counter extends along the wall, with cabinets visible above and a small window letting in afternoon light. A wedge of yellow cheese is placed near the edge of the counter, visibly within reach. Tom, the blue-gray cat, approaches the counter with a focused expression, his eyes fixed on the cheese wedge. Jerry, the brown mouse, is curled up in a tiny ball nearby, seemingly asleep with his eyes closed and his breathing slow and steady. Tom slowly extends his paw toward the cheese, his movements deliberate and careful to avoid making any noise that might wake Jerry.

A spotless kitchen counter extends along the wall, with cabinets visible above and a small window letting in afternoon light. A wedge of yellow cheese is placed near the edge of the counter, visibly within reach. Tom, the blue-gray cat, now has his paw hovering just above the cheese, his claws slightly extended and his whiskers twitching in anticipation. Jerry, the brown mouse, continues to sleep nearby, his small body rising and falling with each breath, unaware of Tom's actions. The camera moves in slightly closer as Tom's paw descends toward the cheese, his fingers just about to make contact with the yellow surface.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A close-up view of the kitchen counter shows the yellow wedge of cheese with Tom's blue-gray paw now making contact with it. The texture of the cheese appears unusually solid in the close light. Tom, the blue-gray cat, has his claws gently touching the surface of what appears to be cheese, his face showing concentration as he prepares to grasp it. Jerry, the brown mouse, is partially visible at the edge of the frame, still in his sleeping position but with one eye now slightly open. As Tom's claws press against the cheese surface, they make a distinctive tapping sound against what is clearly a hard surface, not soft cheese.

A close-up view of the kitchen counter shows the yellow wedge of what appeared to be cheese but is now revealed to be a painted rock. The yellow paint has slight scratches where Tom's claws made contact. Tom, the blue-gray cat, pulls his paw back with his fingers visibly throbbing red with pain, his eyes widening in surprise and discomfort at the deception. Jerry, the brown mouse, is now fully awake, sitting up with his hands on his stomach and a wide grin spreading across his face as he watches Tom's reaction. The camera captures Tom's expression changing from anticipation to pain as he holds his injured paw in his other paw, gently blowing on his throbbing fingers.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The kitchen counter is shown from a different angle, with the painted rock-cheese still visible and a small jar of yellow paint with a brush leaning against it now in view. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands back from the counter, his injured paw wrapped in a small white cloth as he glares at the fake cheese with narrowed eyes and a frown. Jerry, the brown mouse, sits upright on the counter beside his handiwork, his small paws clutching his sides as his body shakes with silent laughter. Tom looks down at Jerry with a mixture of anger and embarrassment while Jerry points at the rock and then at Tom's bandaged paw, clearly amused by the success of his prank.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A view of the kitchen floor shows black and white tiles stretching toward the refrigerator in the background. A small mouse hole is visible in the baseboard along the wall. Tom, the blue-gray cat, sits on the floor nursing his bandaged paw, his tail twitching irritably as he watches the mouse hole with a defeated expression. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands in the entrance of his mouse hole, leaning against the frame with his arms crossed and a triumphant smile on his face. Jerry winks at the camera while making a victorious thumbs-up gesture, then takes a casual step backward into his hole as Tom continues to glare at him from across the kitchen floor.

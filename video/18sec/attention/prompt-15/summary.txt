The small, circular mouse hole carved into the white baseboard features worn edges with a distinct crack extending upward from its top, while Jerry positions himself precisely halfway out of the entrance with his left paw resting against the curved interior wall and his right foot tentatively extended into the living room. His expressive brown eyes are fixed intently on Tom, who lounges diagonally across the armchair with his tail hanging over one armrest, front paws delicately holding the chocolate chip cookie as he takes small, appreciative bites that send tiny crumbs cascading onto his blue-gray chest fur and the fabric below. The warm afternoon light filtering through a nearby window creates a golden halo effect around Tom's whiskers, which twitch slightly with each satisfied bite as a look of pure contentment spreads across his face.

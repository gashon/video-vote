Jerry, the brown mouse, lies curled up on the cushion with his eyes closed, his small chest rising and falling with each peaceful breath. Across the room, Tom, the blue-gray cat, sits perfectly still near the doorway, his green eyes fixed intently on the sleeping mouse. Tom's whiskers twitch slightly as he observes Jerry from his position, maintaining complete silence as he watches the mouse doze.

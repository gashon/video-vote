The dimly-lit living room features a plush cushion on a wicker chair now cast in partial shadow as evening approaches, where Jerry the brown mouse sleeps soundly curled on his side with his tail wrapped protectively around his tiny body, whiskers occasionally twitching with each gentle breath. Across the room on a small round rug, Tom the blue-gray cat has completely succumbed to exhaustion, his vigilant posture abandoned as he lies fully curled up with his tail tucked around himself, eyes firmly closed and body rising and falling with deep slumber, creating a peaceful tableau as both predator and prey rest in their respective corners while darkness gradually envelops the cozy space.

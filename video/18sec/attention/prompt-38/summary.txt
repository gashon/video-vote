The spacious kitchen features pristine white tiles, warm wooden cabinets, and a polished granite countertop, with natural light streaming through the window above the sink, highlighting the immaculate surfaces. Tom, a blue-gray cat with bright alert eyes, stands cautiously by the counter, eyeing a substantial sandwich layered with crisp lettuce, juicy tomato slices, and thick cuts of meat resting on a gleaming white ceramic plate. With meticulous precision, Tom's left paw grasps the real sandwich while his right paw positions an identical rubber replica on the plate, arranging it at exactly the same angle as the original, his whiskers twitching slightly with concentration.

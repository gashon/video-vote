The sunlit garden showcases vibrant tall flowers with green stems swaying gently against a clear blue sky, as several yellow and orange butterflies flutter between blooms. Jerry, the small brown mouse with rounded ears, sits cross-legged atop a particularly large red flower with velvety petals, his tiny paws holding a triangular wedge of Swiss cheese with visible holes, taking delicate nibbles while his whiskers twitch with each bite and his smug expression features half-lidded eyes and a satisfied grin. Below him stands Tom, the blue-gray cat with white patches on his chest and paws, his fur matted with clumps of dark soil that occasionally sprinkle onto the ground, shoulders slumped in defeat as he grips a wooden broom with splinters visible on its handle, his green eyes narrowed upward and whiskers drooping while his tail hangs motionless behind him.

A bright kitchen with white tiled floors and yellow walls is visible. Wooden cabinets line the walls and a refrigerator stands in the corner. Tom, the blue-gray cat, kneels on the kitchen floor, carefully placing a wedge of yellow cheese beneath a wooden box. The box is propped up with a thin stick attached to a string, forming a simple trap. Tom gently positions the cheese bait directly under the center of the box, looking over his shoulder cautiously as he adjusts the trap's position.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, holds the end of a string connected to the stick supporting the box trap. He moves slowly backward toward the refrigerator, keeping his eyes fixed on the cheese and trap. Tom presses his back against the refrigerator and crouches down low, continuing to hold the string while a sly smile spreads across his face as he peers intently at his trap.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, is hidden behind the refrigerator with only his eyes and paws visible as he grips the string. His eyes narrow with anticipation and he covers his mouth with one paw to stifle a snicker. Tom's shoulders shake slightly as he continues to snicker, maintaining his grip on the string while scanning the kitchen for any sign of Jerry.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A cozy living room with brown carpeting, beige walls, and a large window letting in sunlight through white curtains. A plush sofa sits against one wall while a coffee table occupies the center of the room. Jerry, the brown mouse, sits comfortably atop a large blue cushion placed on the sofa. The cushion has visible indentations and Jerry's small body makes a deeper impression as he settles into its soft surface. The camera zooms in slightly as Jerry holds a piece of cheese between his tiny paws.

A plush sofa sits against one wall while a coffee table occupies the center of the room. Jerry, the brown mouse, remains seated on the blue cushion, which now has several cheese crumbs scattered around it. Jerry brings the cheese wedge to his mouth and takes a small bite, chewing slowly with his eyes half-closed in contentment. The camera pans down slightly to show more of the cushion, revealing additional crumbs that have fallen onto its surface.

A plush sofa sits against one wall while a coffee table occupies the center of the room. Jerry, the brown mouse, reclines further back on the blue cushion with his small stomach slightly extended. Cheese crumbs cover the surrounding cushion surface and a few have fallen onto the sofa. Jerry closes his eyes and places both paws on his belly, a satisfied smile spreading across his face as he continues to munch on the remains of the cheese wedge.

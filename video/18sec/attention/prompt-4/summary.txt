Tom, the blue-gray cat with distinctive whiskers and round ears, sits uncomfortably on the beige sofa with his fur noticeably matted and darkened where milk has soaked through from the pillow beneath him; his face displays a pronounced grimace with furrowed brows, squinted eyes, and mouth drawn into a tight line while his paws grip the edge of the cushion. Meanwhile, Jerry, the small brown mouse with large rounded ears and a pink nose, is partially visible from his perfectly circular mouse hole in the baseboard, his tiny paws covering his mouth as his cheeks bulge and eyes crinkle with suppressed laughter, his tail curling upward behind him in delight at Tom's misfortune.

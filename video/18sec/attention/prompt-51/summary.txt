The sun-drenched garden features vibrant green grass, meticulously arranged multicolored flower beds, and a perfectly circular pond with crystalline blue water occupying the central space. Tom, the blue-gray cat with distinctive whiskers and pink inner ears, continues his trance-like pursuit with closed eyelids and extended paws, his nose twitching repeatedly as he follows the pungent yellow cheese wedge Jerry has strategically positioned at the pond's stone-lined edge. As Tom's left front paw extends beyond the solid ground and meets nothing but air, his body momentarily freezes in place before his eyes snap open to reveal dilated pupils surrounded by yellow irises, his mouth forming a perfect "O" shape while his whiskers stiffen outward in alarm. The cat's body begins its inevitable forward momentum into the water, his limbs frantically windmilling in midair as his tail stands perfectly straight with a slight curl at the tip, while tiny droplets of water already splash upward to meet his descending form.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, peeks from behind the doorway on the left side of the room, his ears perked up and eyes focused. Jerry, the brown mouse, is sleeping peacefully on the red cushion, curled up with his eyes closed. Tom carefully steps into the room on his tiptoes, moving slowly toward the sofa while holding a small mouse trap with a piece of cheese attached to it.

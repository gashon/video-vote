A kitchen with white tiles, wooden cabinets, and a yellow countertop extends across the frame. A large window with blue curtains is visible on the far wall, and a wooden shelf holding several books is mounted near the ceiling. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is lying on his side on the tiled floor, curled up with his eyes closed, deep in sleep. His tail extends behind him, relaxed and motionless. Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges from his mouse hole in the baseboard and cautiously approaches the sleeping cat, carrying a long piece of string in his tiny paws.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, continues to sleep soundly on the floor, his body rising and falling with each breath. Jerry, the brown mouse, is now standing beside Tom's tail with the string in his paws. The mouse carefully ties one end of the string around the tip of Tom's tail, making a secure knot while occasionally glancing at Tom's face to ensure the cat remains asleep.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, stirs slightly but remains asleep on the floor, his whiskers twitching. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on his hind legs beside the kitchen wall, holding the other end of the string which is now tied to Tom's tail. The mouse stretches up and ties the free end of the string to a thick, heavy book on the edge of the shelf above, then steps back to admire his handiwork before walking toward his mouse hole.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, is now awake, sitting upright on the floor with an alert expression. His ears perk up as he spots Jerry, the brown mouse, who is standing at the entrance of his mouse hole in the baseboard. The cat's eyes narrow with determination as he rises to a crouching position, preparing to move toward the mouse while completely unaware of the string attached to his tail and the heavy book on the shelf.

A large window with blue curtains is visible on the far wall, and a wooden shelf holding several books is mounted near the ceiling. Tom, the blue-gray cat, lunges forward toward Jerry's mouse hole with his paws outstretched. Suddenly, the string tied to his tail goes taut, and the heavy book slides off the shelf. The cat's forward motion is abruptly halted as the book pulls on the string, yanking him backward with his eyes widening in surprise and his claws scraping against the floor tiles.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A garden with bright green grass, colorful flower beds, and a tall oak tree dominates the background. In the center stands a large stone birdbath filled with clear blue water, surrounded by small pebbles and decorative shrubs. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is suspended in mid-air above the birdbath, fragments of glass around him from the broken window, his limbs spread out in four directions and his face frozen in a look of shock. Tom splashes down into the birdbath, creating a spray of water that arcs upward and then rains back down on his drenched fur, while the cat's expression shifts from shock to misery.

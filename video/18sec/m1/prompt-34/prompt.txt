A bright, spacious kitchen with white tiled flooring, wooden cabinets, and a rectangular wooden table positioned near the center. Sunlight streams through a nearby window, illuminating the room with a warm glow. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands beside the wooden table with a careful, concentrated expression as he delicately places a full glass of milk right at the edge of the table. Tom steps back slowly, tilting his head to admire his precarious setup, his whiskers twitching slightly as he observes the balanced glass.

Jerry, the brown mouse, lies curled up in a small ball on the floor directly beneath the edge of the table, his eyes closed peacefully in slumber.

A brick fireplace occupies one wall, with a few framed pictures hanging above it. Tom, the blue-gray cat, sits on the cozy sofa with a relaxed posture, his tail curled around his body as he holds a newspaper open in front of him.

Jerry, the brown mouse, enters through the doorway on the left, looking over his shoulder with concern evident in his expression.

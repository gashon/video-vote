Tom, the blue-gray cat, is curled up on the floor directly in front of the refrigerator, sleeping peacefully with his tail stretched out behind him. Jerry, the brown mouse, approaches Tom from behind with a mischievous expression, carefully lifting Tom's long tail in his tiny paws. Jerry slowly wraps Tom's tail around the refrigerator handle, making a loose knot while glancing occasionally at Tom's face to ensure he remains asleep.

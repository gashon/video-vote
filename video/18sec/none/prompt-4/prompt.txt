A cozy living room with a beige sofa against a light blue wall. A small wooden side table stands next to the sofa, and a cream-colored carpet covers the floor. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands beside the sofa holding a fluffy white pillow in his paws. Tom carefully places the white pillow on the center of the beige sofa, smoothing it out with his paws.

The camera follows Tom from the side as he takes slow, careful steps through the hallway.

A hallway with light yellow walls connects the kitchen and living room. The hallway floor is covered with a patterned runner rug. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is midway through the hallway, holding a glass of milk that is now tilting dangerously. Tom loses his grip on the glass, causing milk to spill onto the white pillow on the sofa ahead. The camera captures the moment as the milk creates a large wet spot on the pillow, while Tom watches with widening eyes.<end_scene>

Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands beside the sofa looking down at the now milk-soaked white pillow. Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks out from a small mouse hole in the baseboard near the floor. Tom approaches the sofa slowly, unaware of the wet pillow, while Jerry watches intently from his hole. The camera angle captures both Tom preparing to sit and Jerry's amused expression.

Tom's face contorts into a grimace as the wetness seeps through his fur, while Jerry covers his mouth to suppress his laughter. The camera zooms in slightly to capture Tom's discomfort and Jerry's amused reaction.

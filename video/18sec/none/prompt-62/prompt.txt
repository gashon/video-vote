A cozy living room with a neutral-colored wooden floor and light beige walls. A simple brown armchair sits in the corner with a small end table beside it. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands in the center of the room looking down at a small, stale cracker on the floor. Jerry reaches down with both paws and carefully picks up the stale cracker, examining it with a curious expression on his face. The camera follows Jerry as he slowly lifts the cracker to eye level, turning it slightly to inspect its hardness.

<start_scene>A clean kitchen with white tiled flooring and pale blue walls. A refrigerator stands against the far wall, and a small water bowl sits on the floor near a wooden cabinet. Jerry, the brown mouse, walks slowly into the kitchen from the doorway on the left, still holding the stale cracker in his paws. Jerry approaches the water bowl with deliberate steps, his tail swaying gently behind him.

Jerry carefully lowers the cracker into the water bowl, holding it submerged with one paw while watching it intently. The camera remains still, focused on Jerry as he stands patiently by the bowl, occasionally tilting his head to check the softening progress of the cracker.

<start_scene>A cozy living room with a neutral-colored wooden floor and light beige walls. A simple brown armchair sits in the corner with a small end table beside it. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is lounging on the armchair with half-lidded eyes, while Jerry, the brown mouse, sits on the floor with the softened cracker. Jerry takes a satisfying bite of the softened cracker, chewing contentedly while small crumbs fall onto the floor. The camera shows both characters in a wide shot as Tom watches Jerry with disinterest, barely turning his head to acknowledge the mouse's enjoyment of his simple meal.

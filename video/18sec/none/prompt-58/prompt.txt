A wooden bookshelf stands against a cream-colored wall in a cozy living room. A plush armchair sits nearby, and warm sunlight filters through translucent curtains hanging on a window. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is sleeping peacefully in the armchair, his body relaxed and his eyes closed. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands at the bottom of the bookshelf, looking up at the rows of books with curiosity. Jerry carefully examines the books on the lower shelf, then slowly reaches up and gently pulls a large red book partway off the shelf.

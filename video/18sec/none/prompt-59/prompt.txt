A cushion sits on the floor near the center of the room, bathed in soft afternoon light from a nearby window. Jerry, the brown mouse, is curled up sleeping peacefully on the cushion, his small body rising and falling with each breath. The camera slowly pans across the room, capturing the serene atmosphere as Jerry continues his peaceful slumber on the cushion.

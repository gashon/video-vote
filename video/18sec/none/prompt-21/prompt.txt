A windowsill bathed in warm afternoon sunlight stretches across one side of a cozy living room with soft beige walls. Sunlight streams through the window panes, casting golden rectangles on the wooden floor below. Jerry, the brown mouse, sits comfortably on the windowsill with his back against the window frame, holding an open book in his small paws. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is lying on a plush red cushion on the floor near the windowsill, his head slightly raised and eyes half-open watching Jerry lazily. Jerry turns a page in his book while Tom's tail gently sways from side to side on the cushion.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains on his plush red cushion, his eyes now blinking slowly as he watches Jerry from his comfortable position. Jerry's reading pace slows as he appears to read the same page for longer, while Tom adjusts his position slightly on the cushion to get more comfortable.

Jerry, the brown mouse, still sits on the windowsill with his book, but now stretches his arms upward in a big yawn, his mouth opening wide showing his tiny teeth.

Jerry rubs one eye with his paw while holding the book with his other hand, and the camera slowly zooms in to capture both characters in the same frame.

Jerry, the brown mouse, closes his book gently and places it beside him on the windowsill, then covers his mouth as another yawn escapes. Tom, the blue-gray cat, watches Jerry from his red cushion and immediately begins to yawn as well, his mouth opening wide and revealing his pink tongue and white teeth. Jerry blinks slowly several times as Tom's yawn finishes, and the camera captures both characters from a side angle to show their synchronized sleepiness.

Jerry's small body slides down an inch along the window frame as his eyes close completely, while Tom's breathing becomes deeper and more rhythmic on his cushion.

The camera slowly pulls back to show both characters sleeping peacefully in their respective spots as dust particles float visibly through the beams of sunlight.

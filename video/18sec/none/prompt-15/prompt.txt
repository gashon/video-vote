A spacious kitchen with white tiled flooring, light yellow walls, and wooden countertops stretches across the scene. A plate of chocolate chip cookies sits on the counter near a refrigerator, with sunlight streaming through a small window above the sink. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on his hind legs at the edge of the counter, looking cautiously around the kitchen. Jerry reaches for one of the cookies, gently picks it up with both paws, and holds it against his chest as he glances nervously from side to side.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The kitchen counter is made of polished wood with a white tiled backsplash. A plate of chocolate chip cookies sits on the right side, with a few crumbs scattered around it. Jerry, the brown mouse, holds a cookie that's almost as big as himself in his small paws. Jerry carefully steps away from the plate, walking slowly to the left edge of the counter with the cookie clutched to his chest, his small ears perked up attentively as he moves.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A cozy living room with beige walls, hardwood flooring, and a small red rug in the center fills the scene. A brown armchair sits against the wall, with a small wooden side table next to it. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is curled up asleep on the armchair, his chest rising and falling gently with each breath. Jerry, the brown mouse, appears at the entrance of the living room, still holding the large chocolate chip cookie in his paws. Jerry tiptoes slowly across the floor towards the sleeping Tom, carefully holding the cookie above his head, his tiny feet making deliberately quiet steps.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, begins to stir on the armchair, his eyes slowly opening as his nose twitches at the scent of the cookie. Jerry, the brown mouse, watches from a few feet away, backing slowly toward a small mouse hole in the baseboard. Tom sits up in the chair, stretches his front paws forward, and notices the cookie on the side table with widening eyes.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A small, circular mouse hole is cut into the white baseboard of the living room wall. The hole has slightly worn edges and a small crack extending from the top. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands just inside the entrance of his mouse hole, with only half of his body visible to the room outside. From his partially hidden position, Jerry watches as Tom, the blue-gray cat, sits contentedly in his armchair across the room, happily munching on the cookie with crumbs falling onto his fur.

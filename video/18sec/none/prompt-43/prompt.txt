Jerry, the brown mouse, sits comfortably in a miniature armchair, quietly reading a book that he holds in his paws. Jerry appears relaxed as he turns a page of his book, his eyes focused on the text as the light from the lamp illuminates the pages.

Jerry, the brown mouse, continues sitting in his miniature armchair, absorbed in reading his book which he holds steadily in front of him. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is partially visible outside the mouse hole entrance, his eye peering in curiously.

A potted plant with bright red flowers sits on a wooden stand near the mouse hole entrance. Tom, the blue-gray cat, crouches low near the mouse hole, which is visible as a small arch in the baseboard. A piece of yellow cheese lies on the floor between Tom and the mouse hole entrance. Tom stretches his paw slowly toward the mouse hole while keeping his body low to the ground, his whiskers twitching in anticipation as his eyes remain fixed on the entrance.

A potted plant with bright red flowers sits on a wooden stand near the mouse hole entrance. Tom, the blue-gray cat, extends his paw fully toward the mouse hole, his body now stretched out on the carpet.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, lies flat on his stomach with his paw extended toward the mouse hole, eyes wide with alarm. The piece of yellow cheese remains untouched on the floor as the plant stand continues to wobble. The potted plant tilts dangerously to one side and begins to fall directly above Tom's head as he freezes in position, his ears flattening against his head.<end_scene>

Jerry, the brown mouse, remains seated in his miniature armchair, peacefully reading his book with a serene expression. Through the round entrance of the mouse hole, the lower portion of Tom's face is visible, now covered in dark soil and plant debris, with a single red flower petal stuck to his fur. Jerry calmly turns another page of his book, completely undisturbed by the commotion outside as he continues his peaceful reading session.

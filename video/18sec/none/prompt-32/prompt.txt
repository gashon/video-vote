A wooden kitchen table sits in the center of a bright kitchen with white walls and tiled floor. Sunlight streams through a window on the right, illuminating the table where a large chocolate chip cookie rests on a small plate. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is curled up asleep on a chair next to the table, his eyes closed and his breathing slow and steady. Jerry, the brown mouse, carefully emerges from his mouse hole in the baseboard, eyeing the cookie on the table with interest. The camera follows Jerry as he quietly tip-toes across the kitchen floor towards the table leg, occasionally glancing at the sleeping Tom.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains asleep on the chair, his chest rising and falling rhythmically with soft purring sounds. Jerry, the brown mouse, slowly climbs up the table leg, pausing halfway to look back at Tom to ensure he's still sleeping.

<start_scene>A lush garden with green grass stretches across the frame, bordered by colorful flowers and a small stone path. A wooden fence is visible in the background with tree branches hanging overhead, creating dappled shadows on the ground. Jerry, the brown mouse, walks slowly along the stone path holding the large chocolate chip cookie with both paws, the cookie almost as big as he is. Jerry stops in the middle of the garden path and sits down on a small rock, holding the cookie up to examine it in the sunlight. Jerry takes a small bite from the edge of the cookie, his expression changing to one of enjoyment as he savors the taste.<end_scene>

Sunlight streams through a window on the right, illuminating the table where an empty plate rests, missing the cookie that was previously there. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is beginning to stir on the chair, his eyes slowly opening as he stretches his front paws forward.

<start_scene>A small, cozy mouse hole in the kitchen baseboard is visible, with rounded edges and a tiny wooden door partially open. The hole is lit from within with a warm glow, showing glimpses of miniature furniture inside. Jerry, the brown mouse, sits at the entrance of his mouse hole, the partially-eaten cookie beside him on a tiny mouse-sized plate. Jerry watches Tom with an amused expression, a small smile forming on his face as he sees the cat's disappointment. Jerry picks up the cookie, takes another small bite, and continues to smile contentedly while Tom's audible sigh can be heard from across the kitchen.

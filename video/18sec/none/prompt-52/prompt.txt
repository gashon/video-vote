A cozy living room with wooden floorboards and cream-colored walls. A small mouse hole is visible in the baseboard on the right side, and a vintage armchair sits in the background on the left. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands in the center of the room holding a round chocolate chip cookie in both paws. Jerry carefully places the cookie on the wooden floor, then slowly steps backward toward his mouse hole while keeping his eyes on the cookie.

<start_scene>A close-up view of Tom's face against a blurred cream background. The cookie is held in Tom's paw just in front of his mouth. Tom, the blue-gray cat, has a pleased expression as his mouth opens to take a bite of the cookie. Tom's expression slowly changes from delight to confusion as his teeth fail to break through the cookie, instead causing the rubber cookie to bend and flex.<end_scene>

Tom stares at the rubber cookie with a disappointed expression while Jerry continues to giggle uncontrollably from the safety of his mouse hole.

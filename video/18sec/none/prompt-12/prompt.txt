A cozy living room with a beige cushion placed on a light brown wooden floor. The walls are painted in a soft cream color, and a small coffee table is visible in the background. Jerry, the brown mouse, is curled up peacefully on the beige cushion, his eyes closed and his small body rising and falling gently with each breath. Jerry's tiny paws are tucked under his body as he sleeps soundly, completely unaware of his surroundings.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, is leaning forward with the brown wooden broom extended, gently poking the edge of the beige cushion.

Jerry, the brown mouse, is curled up on the beige cushion, having fallen back to sleep after his brief awakening, his small chest rising and falling rhythmically. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands nearby with the brown wooden broom in his paws, shoulders slumping forward as his expression changes from determination to resignation.

<start_scene>A hallway with light blue walls and a wooden floor extends into the distance. A small side table with a vase is visible along the right wall. Tom, the blue-gray cat, walks slowly away from the camera with his head lowered and the brown wooden broom dragging behind him in his right paw. Tom's shoulders are hunched forward in defeat, and his tail drags limply on the floor as he moves further down the hallway. The camera remains stationary as Tom's figure grows smaller with distance.

A bright, spacious kitchen with yellow walls, white cabinets, and a wooden table and chair in the center. A refrigerator stands against the wall, and sunlight streams through a window above the sink. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is curled up asleep on a small cushioned bed near the kitchen counter, his chest rising and falling with each breath. Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges from his mouse hole in the baseboard, glancing cautiously around before tiptoeing toward the wooden chair at the center of the kitchen.

<start_scene>A small bathroom with blue tiled walls, a white porcelain bathtub filled with bubbles, and a wooden cabinet in the corner.

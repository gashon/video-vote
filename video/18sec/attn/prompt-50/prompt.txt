A spacious kitchen with white tiled counters, a wooden table, and light green walls. A refrigerator stands against the far wall, and a window lets in soft daylight from above the sink. Jerry, the brown mouse, crouches near a piece of yellow cheese on the counter, looking mischievous as he holds a thin rubber band between his paws. Jerry slowly stretches the rubber band, carefully slips it around the middle of the cheese slice, and then steps back with a satisfied expression, watching as the cheese sits there with the rubber band barely visible.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, approaches the counter where the cheese sits, his eyes fixed hungrily on the yellow wedge, while Jerry, the brown mouse, watches from behind a nearby salt shaker. Tom extends his paw toward the cheese, his fingers spreading wide to grasp it, while Jerry observes with anticipation, his small paws covering his mouth to suppress a giggle.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, touches the cheese with his paw, causing the rubber band to snap back suddenly, launching the cheese away from his grasp. The cheese flies across the kitchen toward the doorway, as Tom watches with a surprised expression, his paw still extended where the cheese had been, while Jerry, the brown mouse, covers his mouth with both paws, his eyes wide with delight.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A cozy living room with a worn rug on the wooden floor, a sofa against the wall, and a stone fireplace on the far side. A large floor lamp casts a warm glow over the space, highlighting the patterns of the wallpaper. Spike, the gray dog, lies curled up on a round dog bed near the center of the room, sleeping peacefully with his eyes closed and his body rising and falling with each breath. The cheese from the kitchen flies into the frame from the left, traveling in a gentle arc through the air toward Spike's location, while the camera pans slowly to follow its trajectory.

Spike, the gray dog, still lies on his round dog bed as the cheese smacks directly into his face with a soft thud, sticking momentarily to his cheek. Spike's eyes snap open in surprise, his brow immediately furrowing as the cheese slides down his face, while his body tenses and he slowly raises his head from the dog bed.

Spike, the gray dog, sits upright on his dog bed, growling with his teeth bared and his eyes narrowed in anger as he looks toward the kitchen doorway. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands frozen in the doorway between the kitchen and living room, his fur standing on end, his eyes wide with terror, and his body trembling as he realizes Spike has spotted him, while the cheese lies on the floor beside Spike's bed.

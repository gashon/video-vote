A spacious kitchen with wooden cabinets, a tiled floor, and a marble countertop stretches across the scene. A refrigerator stands against the far wall, and sunlight streams through a small window above the sink. Tom, the blue-gray cat, sits at a small table in the center of the kitchen, contentedly eating a cheese sandwich on a plate. Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks out from behind a potted plant on the counter, eyeing the sandwich with interest. Jerry slowly emerges from behind the plant and tiptoes toward the table while Tom is distracted by looking out the window.

A refrigerator stands against the far wall, and sunlight streams through a small window above the sink. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is seated at the small table in the center of the kitchen, his attention now focused on a newspaper beside his plate with the half-eaten cheese sandwich. Jerry, the brown mouse, carefully climbs onto the table and approaches the sandwich from behind Tom's newspaper. Jerry reaches the sandwich and gently pulls it away from Tom's plate, moving slowly to avoid making noise.

A refrigerator stands against the far wall, and sunlight streams through a small window above the sink. Tom, the blue-gray cat, lowers his newspaper and looks down at his empty plate with a confused expression, his paws still positioned as if holding something. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands at the edge of the table holding the cheese sandwich that is almost as big as he is, a mischievous grin spreading across his face. Jerry turns and walks toward a mouse hole in the baseboard near the refrigerator, the sandwich clutched in both paws as Tom notices him and his eyes widen in surprise.<end_scene>

A garden shed stands in the background, and a birdbath is visible to the right of the frame. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands beside an outdoor mouse hole at the base of a tree, holding a green watering can positioned above the hole entrance. Tom's posture is hunched slightly forward in anticipation, his tail swaying gently as he watches the mouse hole with narrowed eyes. The camera focuses on Tom's patient stance as he adjusts his grip on the watering can, tilting it slightly to ensure water will pour directly into the hole.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands above Jerry with the green watering can, a satisfied smile forming on his face as he prepares his trap. Jerry looks up just as Tom begins tilting the watering can further, the mouse's expression changing from confidence to concern as he notices the shadow of the cat and watering can above him.

Jerry is thoroughly drenched as water cascades over him, the cheese sandwich dissolving into a soggy mess in his paws. The camera captures the scene from a side angle as Jerry stands soaked and dismayed, pieces of bread and cheese falling apart while Tom wears a triumphant grin, continuing to tilt the watering can.

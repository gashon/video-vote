A bright kitchen with a wooden table stands in the middle of the room. Sunlight streams through the window, illuminating the checkered floor tiles and white walls. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands near the kitchen table with his back slightly arched. Jerry, the brown mouse, is on the table, gripping a large wedge of yellow cheese that is almost the same size as himself. Tom's eyes widen as he notices Jerry with his prized cheese, and his tail begins to twitch with irritation as Jerry starts to move away with the cheese.

A bright kitchen with a wooden table stands in the middle of the room. Sunlight streams through the window, illuminating the checkered floor tiles and white walls. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is now reaching toward a brown broom that leans against the wall near the refrigerator. Jerry, the brown mouse, is scurrying across the table with the large wedge of yellow cheese clutched in his paws. Tom grabs the broom with his paw, his face contorted in an angry expression as he watches Jerry moving toward the edge of the table.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A white wall with a small circular mouse hole near the floor takes up most of the frame. The checkered kitchen floor extends to the hole, and a portion of the wooden table leg is visible to the right. Jerry, the brown mouse, is partially inside the mouse hole with the yellow cheese wedge being pulled in behind him. Only his rear end and tail are still visible outside the hole. Tom, the blue-gray cat, approaches the mouse hole with the broom firmly gripped in his paws, his posture hunched with determination. Tom extends the broom toward the mouse hole as Jerry's tail disappears completely inside.

A white wall with a small circular mouse hole near the floor takes up most of the frame. The checkered kitchen floor extends to the hole, and a portion of the wooden table leg is visible to the right. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is kneeling before the mouse hole with his face close to the opening. The broom handle is being pushed forcefully into the hole by Tom's paws. Tom's eyes are narrowed in concentration as he continues to shove the broom deeper into the hole, with only the very end of the handle still visible in his grip.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A lush green garden with colorful flowers stretches across the frame. A wooden fence stands in the background, and various flowering plants dot the rich soil. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is emerging from a larger hole in the ground, looking confused with dirt on his fur. His paws still grip the broom handle as his head and shoulders appear from the hole. The camera pans slightly to reveal some displaced soil around the hole as Tom blinks in disorientation at his sudden change of location.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A garden of tall flowers with green stems and colorful petals stands against a blue sky background. Butterflies hover around the flower tops in the gentle breeze. Jerry, the brown mouse, sits comfortably atop a large red flower, legs crossed and the cheese wedge balanced on his lap. His face displays a smug smile as he takes small bites from the cheese. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands below, looking up at Jerry with a defeated expression, the broom hanging limply from his paw as soil continues to fall from his fur.

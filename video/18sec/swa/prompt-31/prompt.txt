Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on the wooden table next to the blue book. Jerry is holding a chocolate chip cookie that's slightly bigger than his paws. Jerry slowly places the cookie on top of the blue book, gently pushing it into position with both paws, leaving behind a small trail of crumbs that extends across the table.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands at the end of the stone path where a single chocolate chip cookie sits on a small flat rock. Tom bends down toward the cookie with a pleased expression, extending his paw to reach for it.

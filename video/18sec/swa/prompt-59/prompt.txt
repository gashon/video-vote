A bright kitchen with a wooden table in the center. A piece of cheese sits on a plate at the edge of the table. Light streams through a curtained window casting soft shadows on the tiled floor. Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks cautiously from behind a table leg, eyeing the cheese on the plate. His whiskers twitch as he slowly approaches the table, glancing around to ensure no one is watching. The camera follows Jerry's deliberate movement as he begins to climb up the table leg, his tiny paws gripping the wood.

Jerry, the brown mouse, has reached the tabletop and stands next to the plate with the cheese. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is partially visible behind a kitchen counter, watching Jerry with narrowed eyes. Jerry carefully lifts the cheese from the plate and holds it in his paws, examining it with delight. The camera zooms in slightly as Jerry turns and walks toward the edge of the table, cradling the cheese in his arms.

Jerry, the brown mouse, is climbing down the table leg with the cheese held firmly in his mouth. Tom, the blue-gray cat, places a single marble on the floor directly in Jerry's path to his mousehole. Jerry reaches the floor and begins walking toward his mousehole, unaware of the marble Tom has positioned. The camera follows Jerry from the side as he walks confidently across the kitchen floor with his cheese.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A cozy mouse hole with rounded walls of earth and roots visible. Small furniture pieces are arranged inside - a matchbox bed, a thimble chair, and a spool table. A small lamp made from a bottle cap provides warm light. Jerry, the brown mouse, enters his underground home through the mousehole entrance, still carrying the cheese in his mouth. A small round marble sits in the middle of the floor, directly in Jerry's path. Jerry walks forward into his home, still unaware of the marble obstacle in his path. The camera tracks Jerry's movement as he takes several steps into his underground home, approaching the marble.

A small lamp made from a bottle cap provides warm light. Jerry, the brown mouse, is mid-step when his foot lands on the marble. His other foot lifts off the ground as he loses his balance. The cheese is still clutched in his paws but his grip loosens. Jerry's eyes widen in surprise as he begins to tip backward, his foot rolling on the marble. The camera holds steady, capturing Jerry's expression changing from confidence to alarm as his balance fails him.

A small lamp made from a bottle cap provides warm light. Jerry, the brown mouse, is falling backward with his arms flailing. The cheese flies out of his hands toward a small hole in the wall. Tom, the blue-gray cat, has his paw inserted through the small hole in the wall of Jerry's home. The cheese lands perfectly in Tom's waiting paw as Jerry falls onto his back on the floor. The camera zooms out slightly to show both Jerry on the floor and the cheese being withdrawn through the hole by Tom's paw.

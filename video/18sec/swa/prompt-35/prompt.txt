A spacious kitchen with white tiled floor and light blue walls. A wooden door with a brass knob stands closed on the left side, and a refrigerator is positioned against the back wall. Tom, the blue-gray cat, carefully balances a white ceramic bowl filled with milk on top of the partially open door, making sure it's positioned to fall when the door moves. The bowl wobbles slightly as Tom adjusts it with his paws, then steps back to examine his handiwork while a mischievous smile spreads across his face. The camera shows a medium shot of Tom placing the bowl on the door.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, tiptoes away from the door with the precariously balanced milk bowl and moves toward the refrigerator with hunched shoulders and a paw covering his mouth. Tom slides behind the refrigerator until only his eyes and the top of his head are visible, watching the door intently while occasionally letting out a soft snicker. The camera pulls back slightly to show both the door trap and Tom's hiding spot.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A cozy living room with a beige carpet and cream-colored walls. A green couch sits against the back wall, and a small wooden coffee table is positioned in the center of the room with a flower vase on it. Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges from a small circular mouse hole in the baseboard on the right side of the room, his whiskers twitching as he surveys the area. Jerry walks cautiously into the room, looking from side to side, his small paws making no sound on the carpet as he approaches the couch with a curious expression. The camera follows Jerry's movement across the room.

A green couch sits against the back wall, and a small wooden coffee table is positioned in the center of the room with a flower vase on it. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands beside the green couch and lifts his paw to press down on a loose cushion that appears slightly raised. As Jerry's weight pushes down on the cushion, a subtle mechanical click is heard, and Jerry tilts his head in confusion at the sound. The camera zooms in slightly on Jerry's puzzled expression.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A spacious kitchen with white tiled floor and light blue walls. A wooden door with a brass knob stands closed on the left side, and a refrigerator is positioned against the back wall. The kitchen door slowly swings open from the living room side, causing the bowl of milk to tilt precariously on its edge. The white ceramic bowl tips forward and begins to fall as the door continues to open, milk sloshing at the rim of the bowl. The camera focuses on the falling bowl as it descends toward the floor.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, peeks out from behind the refrigerator with an expectant grin, looking toward the now-open door. The bowl of milk completes its fall, missing the floor entirely and landing upside down on Tom's head, drenching his blue-gray fur with white milk that drips down his face and whiskers. The camera zooms in on Tom's shocked expression as milk continues to drip from his ears and whiskers.

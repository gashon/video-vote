A cozy kitchen with light blue walls, white cabinets, and a tiled floor. A wooden door stands slightly ajar on the left side, and a dark green couch sits against the right wall. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is curled up on the couch, eyes closed, his chest rising and falling with each breath as he naps peacefully. Jerry, the brown mouse, carefully balances a white bowl filled with milk on top of the partially open door, using a small stool to reach the top. The camera follows Jerry as he places the bowl precariously on the door's edge, then steps back to examine his handiwork with a satisfied expression.

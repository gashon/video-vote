The living room features a large window with long green curtains hanging to the floor, framed by the beige wall and wooden baseboard, with a trail of small wet milk paw prints leading directly to the curtain's edge where a subtle bulge reveals Jerry's hiding spot. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands alertly on all fours directly in front of the curtain, his whiskers twitching slightly as his yellow eyes focus intently on the end of the wet trail disappearing beneath the fabric, his tail swishing slowly behind him in anticipation of catching his prey. Jerry, the brown mouse, is partially visible as he peeks out from behind the green curtain fabric, his tiny brown ears perked up and beady eyes widening with alarm, while his small paws grip the edge of the curtain as Tom's gray paw, with extended claws, hovers just inches away from pulling aside the curtain.

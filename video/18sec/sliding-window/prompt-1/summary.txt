The cozy living room features soft beige walls, a green armchair with a plush cushion, and a small wooden side table displaying a modest flower pot with a vibrant red bloom that wobbles slightly after Tom's accidental bump. Jerry, the brown mouse with paws tucked under his chin, momentarily opens one eye at the disturbance, stretches his tiny arms with a big yawn, then shifts position and returns to his peaceful slumber, completely oblivious to any danger. The blue-gray cat Tom, who had been creeping with deliberate steps and a focused expression, freezes with an anxious look and twitching tail when Jerry stirs, ultimately slumping his shoulders in disappointment before retreating to the corner where he sits with a dejected expression, watching the sleeping mouse from afar.

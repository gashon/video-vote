The blue-gray cat Tom stands frozen near his cushion, his wide eyes bulging with shock and jaw slightly agape while his whiskers stiffen outward upon discovering the brown mouse Jerry has audaciously commandeered his reading spot. Jerry reclines with smug satisfaction against Tom's discarded book, his tiny brown body nestled comfortably in the cushion's center indentation, one paw holding a half-eaten wedge of yellow cheese with visible bite marks while his other paw rests casually on his round belly, his long pink tail curled contentedly beside him as he meets Tom's stunned gaze with twinkling eyes and a mischievous grin revealing his tiny front teeth.

A cozy living room with a wooden bookshelf against the wall, a comfortable armchair in the corner, and a large open book on the floor near a small coffee table.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, is crouched low to the ground, a sly grin on his face as he holds a yellow sponge that is cut into the shape of cheese. Tom quietly approaches the large open book where Jerry is eating, carefully holding the fake cheese-shaped sponge in his paw while looking over his shoulder to ensure Jerry doesn't notice him.

A round bowl of milk sits on the tiled floor, with ripples forming across its surface. Jerry, the brown mouse, is in mid-air above the milk bowl as the compressed cheese-shaped sponge expands suddenly in his mouth, propelling him forward. Jerry's face shows surprise and alarm as his body is launched forward, his arms and legs splayed out with the expanded sponge visible in his mouth as he begins to descend toward the milk bowl.

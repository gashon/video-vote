A spacious kitchen with white tiled floors and light blue walls features a wooden table in the center with various food items on it. A large window lets in sunlight, casting soft shadows on the clean countertops. Jerry, the brown mouse, approaches the wooden table cautiously, looking up at a large piece of yellow cheese sitting on a white plate. Jerry glances around to ensure no one is watching, then carefully climbs up one of the table legs to reach the top of the table. The camera remains stationary, capturing Jerry's slow ascent to the tabletop.

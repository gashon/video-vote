A cozy living room with beige walls, wooden furniture, and a soft green sofa against the wall. A small mouse hole is visible at the bottom of one wall. Jerry, the brown mouse, sits inside his mouse hole, comfortably leaning against the curved wall with a small book open in his paws. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is stretched out on the green sofa with his eyes closed, his chest rising and falling slowly with each breath as he sleeps peacefully. The camera shows a wide view of the room, capturing both characters in their separate spaces, with Jerry quietly turning a page of his book while Tom remains undisturbed.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, continues to sleep on the green sofa, his body relaxed and tail hanging off the edge. Jerry accidentally drops his book, which lands on the floor of his mouse hole with a soft thud as the camera focuses on the mouse hole entrance, showing Jerry's startled expression as he realizes what happened.<end_scene>

Tom, the blue-gray cat, is on the green sofa, but his eyes are now open and his ears are perked up as he lifts his head to look toward the mouse hole. Jerry, the brown mouse, is not visible as he remains inside his mouse hole with his dropped book. Tom slowly sits up on the sofa, stretching his front paws forward while the camera follows his gaze toward the mouse hole where the soft thud came from.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, sits patiently in front of the mouse hole, his paws placed neatly together on the floor as he waits without aggression. Jerry, the brown mouse, is partially visible as he cautiously peeks out from the entrance of his mouse hole, only his head and part of one shoulder showing as he assesses the situation. The camera maintains its close position on the mouse hole entrance, capturing Jerry's wary expression as he slowly emerges a tiny bit more, while Tom remains perfectly still, simply watching.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, and Jerry, the brown mouse, face each other near the mouse hole entrance, with Jerry now fully visible but staying close to his doorway. Tom, the blue-gray cat, gives a small, polite nod to Jerry, his whiskers twitching slightly as he acknowledges the mouse. Jerry returns the nod with a similar respectful gesture before retreating back into his mouse hole as Tom turns away and begins walking back toward the green sofa, both characters returning to their previous activities.

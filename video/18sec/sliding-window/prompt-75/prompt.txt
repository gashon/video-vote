A modern kitchen with white tiles, a gas stove on the left, wooden cabinets above, and a counter with various kitchen utensils and ingredients. A half-prepared sandwich sits on a white plate on the kitchen counter with lettuce, tomatoes, and sliced cheese visible. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is curled up on a cushioned chair near the kitchen counter, eyes closed and peacefully napping with gentle rising and falling of his chest. Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges cautiously from a small hole in the baseboard, glancing around before tiptoeing toward the sandwich on the counter.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains asleep on the cushioned chair, his tail occasionally twitching as he dreams.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, continues napping on the cushioned chair, a small bubble forming at his nose that expands and contracts with each breath. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands beside the sandwich holding a pepper shaker that's almost as big as he is, and with a mischievous grin, he sprinkles a generous amount of black pepper across the bread, causing a small cloud of pepper to form above the sandwich.<end_scene>

A window on the right wall shows a garden outside, and a cabinet with fine china stands against the left wall. Tom, the blue-gray cat, sits at the dining table on a wooden chair, holding the pepper-covered sandwich in both paws and bringing it toward his open mouth. Jerry, the brown mouse, hides behind a flower vase in the center of the table, peeking out with an anticipatory smile as he watches Tom prepare to take a bite of the sandwich.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, has just taken a large bite of the sandwich, his cheeks bulging, and his eyes beginning to water as the pepper takes effect.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, with his eyes wide and watering, inhales sharply and then releases an enormous sneeze that sends food particles flying in all directions. Jerry, the brown mouse, is propelled through the air by the force of Tom's sneeze, his limbs flailing as he arcs across the table and lands with a splash into a white ceramic bowl filled with milk, creating a white splash that drenches his fur.

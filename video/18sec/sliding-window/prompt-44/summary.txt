A corner of the living room reveals a large, round cushion positioned on worn wooden flooring beside an off-white radiator, bathed in the soft golden glow of afternoon sunlight filtering through a nearby window and casting gentle, elongated shadows across the floor. Tom, the blue-gray cat with distinctive darker stripes, approaches the cushion with visibly heavy, plodding steps, his emerald-green eyes half-lidded with exhaustion and whiskers slightly drooping, while his tail drags limply behind him. After meticulously circling the cushion once in a clockwise direction, Tom delicately lowers his substantial body onto the plush surface with a barely audible sigh, tucking his front paws neatly beneath his chest, curling his tail around his haunches, and allowing his eyes to close completely as his breathing immediately slows to the steady rhythm of deep slumber.

In the kitchen with its distinctive white and blue checkered tile floors and cream-colored walls, Tom, a blue-gray cat with a relaxed posture and gently swaying tail, approaches the wooden table where a blue ceramic bowl of milk sits, lowering his head to take a substantial gulp. Tom's facial expression transforms dramatically as his eyes widen, cheeks bulge outward, and face flushes red while he opens his mouth in a silent gasp, his paws clutching at his throat as his eyes begin to water from the hot sauce Jerry had previously added. Later in the living room with beige walls, green couch, and wooden coffee table, Tom rushes in with his tongue hanging out and watery eyes, making a beeline for the tall plant stand where a blue flower vase filled with water stands in the corner. As Tom desperately laps at the vase water, causing it to overflow and cascade down the sides, Jerry peeks from his hiding spot behind the couch directly beneath the plant stand, becoming unexpectedly drenched by the falling water while Tom continues his frantic drinking.

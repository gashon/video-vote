Jerry's tiny whiskers twitch rhythmically as he sits perched on a matchbox chair within his meticulously organized mouse hole, the earthen walls adorned with miniature shelves holding thimbles, buttons, and tiny collected treasures while a bed of multicolored fabric scraps rests in the far corner beneath a postage stamp picture. The brown mouse delicately holds the yellow cheese crumb between his paws—his fingers visibly indenting the soft dairy morsel—as he takes a precise bite with his front teeth, his eyes squeezing shut in pure ecstasy while his round ears perk forward and his pink nose crinkles slightly with each chew, a barely perceptible dusting of cheese particles falling onto the matchbox seat below.

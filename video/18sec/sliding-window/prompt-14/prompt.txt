A cozy mouse hole with warm, amber lighting is nestled in the corner of a cream-colored wall. Inside, there's a tiny wooden table with a miniature lamp casting a soft glow, and a small bookshelf filled with tiny books against the inner wall. Jerry, the brown mouse, is sitting comfortably on a thimble chair at the wooden table, holding an open book in his paws, his eyes focused on the pages. Jerry slowly turns a page of his book, adjusting his position slightly on the thimble chair as the camera captures his peaceful reading moment from a side angle.

<start_scene>A spacious living room with a beige sofa against a pale blue wall, a wooden coffee table in front, and a floor lamp in the corner casting soft shadows across the hardwood floor. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is sprawled lazily across the sofa, his head resting on one armrest, his body stretched out, and his eyelids drooping with sleepiness. Tom's eyes slowly begin to close, his head nodding forward slightly as drowsiness overtakes him, while the camera captures this scene from a wide angle showing the entire sofa and surrounding area.<end_scene>

Jerry, the brown mouse, is standing at the entrance of his mouse hole, peering cautiously out into the room, with one paw resting on the circular frame of the entrance.

<start_scene>A spacious living room with a beige sofa against a pale blue wall, a wooden coffee table in front, and a floor lamp in the corner casting soft shadows across the hardwood floor. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is now fully asleep on the sofa, his chest rising and falling gently with each breath, while Jerry, the brown mouse, is tiptoeing across the floor, staying close to the wall, making his way toward the kitchen doorway. Jerry continues his careful journey across the living room floor, constantly glancing up at Tom to ensure the cat remains asleep, while the camera pans slowly to follow Jerry's progress toward the kitchen.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A bright kitchen with white tile flooring, wooden cabinets along the walls, and a refrigerator visible in the corner, with a small round table in the center holding a plate with a wedge of yellow cheese. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands beside the leg of the table, looking up at the cheese on the plate, his small paws pressed together in anticipation. Jerry carefully climbs up the table leg, reaches the tabletop, and picks up a small piece of the cheese, holding it triumphantly before starting to make his way back down, as the camera zooms out to show the full kitchen scene.

A bright kitchen with white tile floors, wooden cabinets, and a round dining table sits in the center of the room. A half-eaten sandwich rests on a white plate on the table. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is seated at the table with his back turned, focused on reading a newspaper. Jerry, the brown mouse, approaches the table from the left side, eyeing the sandwich with interest. Jerry slowly extends his paws toward the sandwich, carefully pinching a chunk of yellow cheese between his fingers and sliding it out from between the bread slices.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains seated at the table reading his newspaper, unaware of what's happening behind him. Jerry, the brown mouse, now holds a large wedge of yellow cheese in his paws and begins backing away from the table. Jerry moves slowly toward a mouse hole in the baseboard of the kitchen wall, glancing over his shoulder at Tom while clutching his prized cheese.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, puts down his newspaper and notices his sandwich has been tampered with. Jerry, the brown mouse, is at the mouse hole in the baseboard, holding the chunk of cheese and looking back at Tom with a mischievous smile.

<start_scene>A dark, narrow tunnel of a mouse hole stretches forward, with a small circle of light visible at the far end. The walls are earthy brown with bits of wood and debris embedded in them. Jerry, the brown mouse, walks through the tunnel holding his chunk of cheese above his head like a trophy. Jerry moves forward toward the light at the end of the tunnel, his silhouette growing smaller as he approaches the exit.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A sunny garden with green grass, colorful flowers, and a stone path leading from a small hole in the exterior wall of the house. A garden hose lies coiled on the grass nearby. Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges from the hole in the wall, proudly holding his cheese wedge up in the air with a triumphant expression. Jerry steps fully out of the hole and onto the garden path, unaware that Tom, the blue-gray cat, is crouched behind a nearby bush holding the end of the garden hose.

A sunny garden with green grass, colorful flowers, and a stone path leading from a small hole in the exterior wall of the house. A garden hose lies partially uncoiled across the grass. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands with one paw on the garden hose nozzle, aiming it directly at Jerry. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands frozen in shock on the garden path, still holding his cheese, as water begins spraying from the hose. The water from the hose creates an arc that drenches Jerry, causing him to sputter and blink as his fur becomes soaked while Tom's face breaks into a satisfied grin.

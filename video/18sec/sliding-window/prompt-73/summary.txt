The blue-gray cat Tom slumbers peacefully on a plush red cushion atop a beige couch, when his whiskers begin twitching from cookie crumbs deliberately placed there by Jerry, a mischievous brown mouse who stands nearby watching his prank unfold. Tom's nose reacts to the foreign particles with increasing sensitivity until his eyes flutter open just before he releases a powerful sneeze that launches his entire body backward off the cushion, sending him tumbling to the floor with an expression of complete surprise, his paws splayed outward and fur slightly ruffled from the unexpected disruption of his nap.

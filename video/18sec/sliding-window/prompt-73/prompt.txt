A clean, organized kitchen with white tiles, a wooden counter, and a refrigerator in the background. Sunlight streams through a small window above the sink, illuminating the cooking area. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on the kitchen counter next to a freshly made sandwich with bread, lettuce, and cheese visible between the slices. Jerry eyes the sandwich carefully, then slowly reaches forward and lifts the top slice of bread, revealing the contents underneath. He delicately grips the edge of a yellow cheese slice with both paws and gradually pulls it from between the bread slices.

Jerry, the brown mouse, holds a slice of yellow cheese in his paws while standing next to the partially disassembled sandwich on the kitchen counter. Jerry places the cheese slice down beside him on the counter, then reaches into his fur and pulls out a bright red chili pepper. He carefully positions the chili pepper in the exact spot where the cheese had been, then slowly lowers the top slice of bread back onto the sandwich.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A cozy living room with a beige sofa against a light blue wall, a small coffee table in the center, and a fireplace on the far wall. A floor lamp casts a warm glow across the comfortable space. Tom, the blue-gray cat, walks into the frame from the left, holding a plate with the sandwich in his paws. Tom sits down on the sofa, placing the plate on his lap, and picks up the sandwich with both paws. He looks at the sandwich with anticipation, opens his mouth wide, and takes a large bite from the corner of the sandwich.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, sits on the sofa with the sandwich in his paws and a bite taken out of it. Tom's eyes suddenly widen in shock, and his face gradually turns from blue-gray to bright red. His ears stand straight up as his expression changes from enjoyment to distress. Heat waves visibly emanate from his head as he looks down at the sandwich, where the red chili pepper is now visible poking out from between the bread slices.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands up from the sofa with his face bright red and steam coming from his ears. Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks out from behind a decorative cushion on the sofa, covering his mouth with his paws as he giggles. Tom drops the sandwich on the floor and walks toward the right side of the frame with his tongue hanging out, fanning his mouth with both paws as he moves toward the kitchen doorway.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A kitchen corner with white tiles, wooden cabinets, and a water bowl on the floor next to the refrigerator. The bowl is blue with the word 'Tom' painted on the side in white letters. Tom, the blue-gray cat, enters the frame from the left, his face still bright red and his tongue hanging out. Jerry, the brown mouse, watches from the doorway, his paws still covering his mouth as he continues to giggle. Tom walks directly to the water bowl, drops to his knees, and plunges his entire face into the water, causing some to splash over the sides and onto the floor.

A kitchen with white tiled walls and a wooden table in the center. A yellow refrigerator stands against the wall, and a potted plant sits in the corner. Tom, the blue-gray cat, peers over the edge of the wooden table where a cube of yellow cheese rests on a small plate. Tom slowly extends his paw toward the cheese, keeping his eyes fixed on the mouse hole visible on the opposite wall. The cat carefully picks up the cheese with his paw and examines it with a thoughtful expression on his face.

He walks over to the corner of the kitchen, positioning himself behind the refrigerator but keeping his eyes on the small plate with the fake cheese.

<start_scene>Inside a cozy mouse hole with light brown walls and a tiny wooden table and chair. A small bed with a matchbox drawer sits in the corner, and a thimble cup rests on the table. Jerry, the brown mouse, sits at his tiny table with the cube of yellow cheese placed in front of him. He opens his mouth wide and bites down firmly on the fake cheese, his teeth sinking into the rubber surface. The camera zooms in as the rubber cheese compresses then suddenly springs back, launching Jerry backward into his wall mirror where his face squashes against the glass surface.

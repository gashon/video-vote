The warm-hued living room features pale yellow walls with subtle imperfections and glossy wooden baseboards, with afternoon sunlight casting golden beams and long shadows across the wooden floorboards where visible dust particles float. Tom, a blue-gray cat with expressive ears and a curled tail, sits cross-legged on a detailed tufted circular cushion, holding an open book with both paws while meticulously turning pages with his right paw, his concentrated expression gradually softening as his eyelids begin to droop and his shoulders relax deeper into the cushion. Jerry, a brown mouse with large round ears and twitching whiskers, stands partially emerged from his smooth-edged mouse hole with a small crack extending upward, leaning against the entrance with one paw while his cautious expression transforms into a small smile as he observes Tom's growing tiredness. Both characters mirror each other's increasing drowsiness with synchronized yawnsâ€”Tom raising one paw to cover his wide yawn while maintaining his grip on the book, and Jerry covering his mouth with both paws as his small shoulders rise and fall with the gesture.

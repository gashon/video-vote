The kitchen baseboard reveals a small mouse hole where pristine white wall meets speckled tile flooring, with a delicate potted plant—its green leaves slightly drooping—positioned approximately eight inches to the right of the opening. Jerry, the brown mouse with his distinctive rounded ears and pink nose, approaches the hole with deliberate steps, his tiny whiskers twitching nervously while his tail drags slightly against the cool tile surface. Tom, the blue-gray cat, observes from approximately four feet away, his emerald eyes narrowed to slits, ears pointed forward attentively, and his striped tail curled slightly at the tip while swaying in a slow, hypnotic rhythm. The afternoon sunlight streams through a nearby window, casting elongated shadows across the kitchen floor and illuminating tiny dust particles floating in the air between predator and prey.

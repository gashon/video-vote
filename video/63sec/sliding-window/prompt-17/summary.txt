The sunlit living room exudes warmth with its plush carpet, comfortable sofa, and brick fireplace, while bookshelves line one wall and diffused natural light filters through partially drawn curtains. Jerry, the brown mouse with delicate whiskers and attentive eyes, sits cross-legged on a small cushion he meticulously positioned earlier, his tiny paws gently holding open a book that appears oversized in his grasp. His expression reflects deep concentration as his eyes scan the pages, occasionally blinking when he reaches the end of a line, while his tail curls slightly around his body for balance. The cushion, with its subtle floral pattern and slight indentation where Jerry sits, contrasts with the beige carpet beneath, while a beam of sunlight creates a perfect reading spotlight that highlights the book's slightly worn edges and cream-colored pages.

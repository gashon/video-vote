The meticulously maintained living room features polished wooden planks illuminated by soft daylight filtering through large curtained windows against cream-colored walls, with a round fabric-textured cushion positioned centrally on the floor. Blue-gray Tom sits with impeccable posture on this cushion, his tail neatly curled beside him, as he holds an open book in his paws, his whiskers occasionally twitching while his eyes methodically scan each page, turning them with careful deliberation, completely absorbed in his reading. Meanwhile, brown-furred Jerry emerges cautiously from his small baseboard hole, his tiny nose and whiskers twitching alertly as he ventures across the wooden floor on delicate paws, eventually pausing directly before Tom's cushion where he rises onto his hind legs to investigate the cat's reading material with squinted eyes. After determining the book holds no interest, Jerry's tiny mouth stretches into a pronounced yawn—revealing his minuscule teeth and pink tongue—before he resumes his unhurried journey across the room while Tom remains utterly oblivious to the mouse's presence, never once lifting his gaze from the pages.

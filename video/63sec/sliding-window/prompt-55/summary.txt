In the warm kitchen with cream walls and checkered tile flooring, Tom the blue-gray cat transitions from sitting upright on a wooden chair with his tail hanging down to fully standing, stretching his arms overhead with deliberate poise. With measured steps, his paws barely audible against the tiles, he approaches the back door, tilts his head upward with focused determination, and carefully manipulates the door handle with his paw. The door swings inward as Tom maintains his grip, gradually revealing a sunlit garden filled with vibrant greenery beyond the kitchen's wooden furnishings and round central table.

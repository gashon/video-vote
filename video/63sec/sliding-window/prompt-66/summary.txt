The cozy bedroom features soft yellow walls bathed in gentle sunlight filtering through blue curtains, with intricate shadows dancing across the polished hardwood floor and highlighting the grain patterns of the large wooden dresser. Tom, the blue-gray cat with subtle darker stripes visible on his tail, stands alertly in the center of the room, his whiskers twitching forward and yellow-green eyes narrowed in concentration as he observes Jerry, the small brown mouse with delicate pink ears and a cream-colored underbelly, who lies completely unaware and peacefully curled into a tight ball on a small white pillow with slightly frayed edges. Jerry's tiny chest rises and falls rhythmically with each breath, his whiskers occasionally quivering and minuscule paws twitching as he dreams, while Tom's tail swishes slowly from side to side in measured, deliberate movements that betray his focused attention on the sleeping mouse.

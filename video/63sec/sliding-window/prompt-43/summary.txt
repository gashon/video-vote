The meticulously maintained living room features honey-colored walls that complement the gleaming oak flooring, with a caramel-toned overstuffed sofa positioned precisely against the left wall while floor-to-ceiling mahogany bookshelves filled with colorful book spines occupy the right side. Sunlight filters through sheer cream curtains hanging from a large bay window, creating dappled patterns across the room and highlighting dust motes floating in the air, while a rectangular doorway with slightly chipped white trim reveals glimpses of tiled flooring in the adjacent kitchen. Jerry, a small brown mouse with delicate pink ears and a cream-colored belly, sits cross-legged on a circular red cushion with gold tassels, initially engrossed in a leather-bound book with gilt-edged pages, his tiny paws carefully turning pages and his whiskers twitching with concentration until his nose begins to wrinkle progressively, eyes squeezing shut as he inhales sharply and finally releases a tiny explosive sneeze. The sudden noise startles Tom, a lanky blue-gray cat with white paws who had been leaning drowsily against the kitchen doorframe with half-closed amber eyes and a limp tail, causing him to jolt upright from his near-slumber, his ears instantly perking forward and pupils dilating in surprise.

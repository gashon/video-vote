The cozy living room features a plush blue couch positioned against a beige wall, with a patterned area rug underneath a small wooden coffee table, all bathed in warm illumination from a strategically placed floor lamp. Tom, a blue-gray cat with expressive whiskers and attentive eyes, transitions from reading intently on the couch—even carefully turning pages with his dexterous paw—to placing a bookmark between pages before stretching his arms overhead. After traversing a cream-walled hallway adorned with framed family photographs and passing a flower-topped side table, Tom enters a bright kitchen featuring white cabinets, light gray countertops, and distinctive cream and light blue checkerboard floor tiles, where his attention fixates on a chocolate chip cookie resting on a blue ceramic plate.

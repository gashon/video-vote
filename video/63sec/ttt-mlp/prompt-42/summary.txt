The kitchen floor features immaculate white and black checkered tiles stretching across the entire space, with a pristine cream-colored wall bordered by a simple wooden baseboard running along its bottom edge. A small, perfectly round mouse hole with visibly worn edges from frequent use sits at the base of the wall, its dark opening contrasting sharply against the light-colored surroundings. Jerry, the brown mouse with delicate whiskers and tiny pink ears, walks confidently upright on his hind legs across the kitchen floor, his satisfied expression and slightly distended belly evidence of his recent cheese feast, while his tiny paws swing gently at his sides with each step toward his dwelling. His chocolate-brown fur catches the ambient kitchen light as he approaches the mouse hole, his pink tail dragging slightly behind him and occasionally twitching with contentment. Upon reaching his destination, Jerry pauses momentarily and pivots his small body to cast one final glance back at the kitchen, his black beady eyes surveying the room with a mixture of satisfaction and vigilance, before he bends forward at the waist and enters his cozy home headfirst, his rounded bottom and long pink tail briefly visible before disappearing completely into the shadowy interior of the hole.

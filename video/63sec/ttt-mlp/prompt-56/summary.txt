In this cozy living room scene, Tom the blue-gray cat sits in a comfortable upholstered chair positioned near a small bookshelf, deeply engrossed in reading a book he holds in his paws. The wooden table nearby has a small plate on top with a wedge of yellow cheese that now shows a small bite mark where Jerry the brown mouse took a piece. A tiny mouse hole is visible at the base of one wall, where Jerry has now returned with his cheese prize. The warm-colored walls and wooden floor complete this peaceful domestic scene where Tom remains completely unaware of Jerry's successful cheese heist.

The spacious kitchen features smooth gray marble countertops cluttered with a wooden cutting board, salt shaker, and unwashed dishes, while a wedge of yellow cheese sits on a small white plate near the counter edge. Jerry, the brown mouse, sits contentedly beside the cheese that now displays several small bites from different angles, rubbing his full belly with both tiny paws after his satisfying feast. Stretching his arms overhead with an arched back, Jerry's ears perk up as he peers over the counter edge and spots Tom, the blue-gray cat, who has abandoned his vigilant crouch and surrendered to sleep on the white tiled floor below. With a satisfied smile at his sleeping adversary, Jerry turns back to the cheese, deliberately breaking off one final morsel to savor while dust particles float through a sunbeam cutting across the kitchen and Tom remains curled up with his head resting on his front paws, breathing slowly and regularly.

In the warm kitchen with light yellow walls and worn countertops, Jerry the brown mouse is startled awake from his peaceful nap by Tom's yawn, his whiskers twitching as his eyes open wide before he quickly rises to his feet and stretches his arms overhead. The blue-gray cat Tom stands vigilantly in the doorway, his tail swaying gently as he fixes his gaze on Jerry, following at a distance as the mouse carefully traverses the baseboards of the beige-walled hallway toward the living room with its patterned runner carpet and framed pictures. Jerry deliberately crosses the living room's carpeted floor toward the couch, skillfully climbing up the textured fabric side until reaching the cushion where he circles once before curling up with his tail wrapped around his body to resume his nap. Tom remains in the white-molded living room doorway beside the light switch, quietly observing the sleeping mouse from afar, his tail continuing its slow, rhythmic swaying behind him.

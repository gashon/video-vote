In a charming bedroom with cream-colored walls and wooden furniture, Tom the blue-gray cat stands beside his round pet bed with raised edges and a fluffy central pillow, where Jerry the brown mouse sleeps soundly, snoring with tiny whiskers occasionally twitching against the soft fabric. Tom's green eyes widen in surprise before he settles onto the hard wooden floor beside his bed, crossing his arms with a disgruntled expression while his tail flicks irritably against the ground as Jerry nestles deeper into the comfortable pillow. After stretching his tiny arms above his head and rolling to his other side, Jerry suddenly awakens, rubbing his eyes with his small paws and arching his back in a full-body stretch before noticing Tom watching him with half-closed, tired eyes and a twitching tail. Jerry cautiously hops down from Tom's bed and walks slowly across the wooden floor toward the hallway, his small paws making no sound as he moves past framed pictures on the warm-toned walls, occasionally glancing back while Tom remains seated, too exhausted to give chase.

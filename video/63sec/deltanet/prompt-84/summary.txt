The cozy living room features a centrally positioned plush armchair where Tom, the blue-gray cat, sits with half-closed eyes in a drowsy state, his tail occasionally twitching as his chest rises and falls with slow, rhythmic breaths. Jerry, the small brown mouse with twitching whiskers, cautiously emerges from his kitchen hole, stands on his hind legs observing the situation, then boldly ventures across the tiled floor toward the living room where he skillfully climbs the wooden table's leg to reach the white ceramic plate containing a large yellow cheese wedge. With determined concentration etched on his tiny face, Jerry methodically pushes the plate across the polished wooden surface toward the window, transfers it onto a vine branch growing along the windowsill, and nimbly descends the vine to the garden grass below. Upon awakening, Tom stretches his front legs forward with an arched back, investigates the conspicuously empty table with twitching whiskers, and follows a visual cue to the garden where he ultimately settles onto a wooden bench beneath a shade tree, surrounded by colorful flower beds, stone pathways, and a glistening bird bath.

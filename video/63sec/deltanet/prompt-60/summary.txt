The mouse hole in the baseboard features perfectly smooth rounded edges worn from frequent use, set against a soft light yellow wall with minute paint texture visible where it meets the pristinely maintained white and blue checkered floor tiles. Jerry, a small brown mouse with delicate whiskers that twitch rhythmically and a slightly rounded belly, approaches his home with deliberate, tiny footsteps that barely make contact with the cool tile surface. His alert ears, pink on the inside with visible tiny veins, rotate slightly as he conducts a final surveillance of the kitchen, his beady black eyes specifically focusing on the wooden table where a wedge of cheese with one corner missing still sits on the white ceramic plate. With a nearly imperceptible wiggle of his thin tail and a subtle puffing of his chest, Jerry slips through the entrance of his home, his fur briefly brushing against the curved wooden edge as his expression transforms into one of complete contentment, tiny mouth curved upward and whiskers relaxed downward in satisfaction.

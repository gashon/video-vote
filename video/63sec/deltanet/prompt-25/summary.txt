The sunlit living room features hardwood floors and cream-colored walls, with soft light filtering through drawn curtains that frame a large window. Tom, the blue-gray cat, enters with relaxed steps from the left, his tail swaying gently as he surveys the room before approaching and settling onto the plush sofa positioned against one wall, directly opposite a fireplace. Jerry, the small brown mouse, cautiously emerges from behind a large book on the bottom shelf of the tall corner bookcase, his tiny paws gripping the shelf edge as he observes Tom with wary curiosity. As Tom shifts position on the sofa and eventually stands, Jerry strategically pulls a smaller book in front of himself to create a better hiding spot, crouching lower with his attentive eyes never leaving the cat's movements across the hardwood floor.

The sunlit living room features a comfortable armchair by a window where tiny brown mouse Jerry sleeps peacefully, his diminutive body rising and falling with each breath, whiskers occasionally twitching as he shifts position while remaining in deep slumber with his paws tucked beneath him and tail dangling slightly over the cushion edge. In the spacious kitchen with its white tiled floor, wooden cabinets, central round table, and window above the sink, blue-gray cat Tom initially slouches against a cabinet in apparent boredom, tail rhythmically tapping the floor while he examines his claws before stretching fullyâ€”front paws extended, back arched upward, tail straight behind him. Tom deliberately walks through the hallway with its light-colored walls, framed pictures, and patterned runner carpet, briefly glancing at the wall decorations before pausing at the living room threshold, where he notices Jerry sleeping, approaches silently with perked ears and tilted head, observes the mouse contemplatively with a gently swaying tail, then turns away and returns through the hallway to his original kitchen spot, his paws making soft tapping sounds against the tiled floor.

The warm-toned living room features beige walls and polished wooden flooring, with filtered sunlight streaming through partially drawn curtains covering a large window, casting a gentle glow across the small bookshelf mounted against the wall and illuminating dust particles floating in the air. A blue-gray cat named Tom engages in remarkably human-like behavior—walking upright, reading a book while seated in the armchair positioned atop a small rug, and even placing a bookmark between pages before venturing to the kitchen where he deliberately retrieves and consumes cheese from the refrigerator. Upon returning to the living room, Tom climbs back into his armchair, yawns widely while covering his mouth with one paw, and gradually succumbs to drowsiness—his eyelids growing heavy and head nodding forward until he finally falls asleep with his head tilted to one side, his chest rising and falling rhythmically in the tranquil atmosphere.

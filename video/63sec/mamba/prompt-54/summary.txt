The blue-gray cat Tom sits comfortably on a wooden garden chair with his tail dangling over the edge and paws resting in his lap, serenely observing his surroundings on a stone-tiled patio adorned with terracotta potted flowers and a wrought iron table nearby. After perking his ears and turning toward the house, Tom rises to all fours on the chair seat, his tail gently swaying before he steps down onto the stone tiles and walks deliberately toward the back door. Upon entering the checkered-floored kitchen with wooden cabinets and sunlit countertops, Tom approaches a cookie jar, stands on his hind legs, carefully removes the lid, reaches inside with his paw, and extracts a chocolate chip cookie which he delicately holds in his mouth as he exits. Returning to the garden patio, Tom jumps back onto his wooden chair with the cookie still in his mouth, places it carefully on his lap, then suddenly raises his head with perked ears toward the house, leaving his treat momentarily untouched.

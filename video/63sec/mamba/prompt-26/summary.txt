The blue-gray cat Tom, initially alert with perked ears and fully opened yellow eyes, rises gracefully from his sunlit armchair and stealthily traverses the beige-walled living room with deliberate, quiet steps toward the kitchen doorway, his tail swaying gently behind him. In the cream-colored hallway with hardwood flooring, Tom fails to notice a thick hardcover book in his path, stepping on its edge with his front paw, causing the book to tilt upward and slide, making him lose balance with his front paws spreading outward as he trips and falls face-first onto the wooden surface with wide, surprised eyes. After recovering from his fall, Tom sits up with visible discomfort, rubbing his chin with one paw before standing fully, nudging the troublesome book against the wall with a slow tail swish, then turning back toward the living room with a noticeably drooping head and tail. Defeated, Tom returns to the living room with hunched shoulders and a limp tail, places his front paws on the armchair cushion, jumps up with measured effort, kneads the fabric briefly, turns in a small circle, and finally curls into a comfortable ball as his eyes slowly close, surrendering to a nap in the warm sunlight streaming through the nearby window.

The sun-drenched bedroom features soft blue walls and warm wooden flooring, with natural light streaming through a large window that casts intricate shadow patterns across the room while illuminating a worn plush armchair with wooden legs that match the floor. Jerry, the brown mouse, lies curled up on a white patterned fluffy pillow atop a small bed, his tiny chest rising and falling rhythmically, whiskers occasionally twitching in his dreams, and small paws tucked beneath his body as he shifts positions in deep slumber. Tom, the blue-gray cat with expressive yellow eyes and perked forward ears, gradually emerges from behind the armchair and carefully approaches the bed, his whiskers twitching with each breath, before standing at the bedside with a surprisingly relaxed rather than predatory posture, opening his mouth in multiple silent yawns that reveal his pink tongue and teeth as his eyelids droop with apparent tiredness.

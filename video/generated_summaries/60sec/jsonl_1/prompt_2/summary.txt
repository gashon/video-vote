The cozy living room features pale yellow walls with subtle paint imperfections and warm, gradually shifting golden light casting elongated shadows across the polished wooden floorboards where visible dust particles dance in the beams of light. Tom, a blue-gray cat with expressive ears that occasionally twitch, sits cross-legged on a detailed circular tufted cushion, his posture initially straight before gradually relaxing as he meticulously turns pages of an open book held in both paws, his concentration evident in his furrowed brow and his tail neatly curled around his body before making slow, subtle movements behind him. Jerry, a brown mouse with large round ears and delicate whiskers, emerges cautiously from his well-worn mouse hole with smooth rounded edges and a small crack extending upward in the glossy wooden baseboard, first peeking out, then leaning against the entrance with one paw while observing Tom, covering his mouth with his paw during multiple yawns that cause his shoulders to rise and fall, his eyelids drooping and head occasionally nodding forward before both characters mirror each other's growing tiredness, with Tom eventually yawning widely while Jerry watches with a small smile forming on his face.

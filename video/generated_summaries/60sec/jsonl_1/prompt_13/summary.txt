The cozy living room features warm yellow walls and wooden flooring with a round wooden table at its center, while a plush red cushion rests against the wall where Tom, the blue-gray cat, sleeps peacefully, his whiskers occasionally twitching and his body shifting positions throughout his slumber. Jerry, the brown mouse, initially sits upright on the wooden table beside a neatly folded blue cloth napkin, observing Tom with curiosity before cautiously standing on his hind legs and making his way to the table edge, where he carefully descends the wooden table leg, his small paws gripping tightly while his tail provides balance. After reaching the floor, Jerry deliberately traverses the polished wooden floorboards toward a worn, round mouse hole in the white baseboard, pausing several times to glance back at the sleeping Tom before finally reaching his destination and slipping inside, his tail being the last part to disappear into the darkness of his home.

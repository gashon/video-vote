The honey-toned hardwood floors of the living room complement soft pastel walls, while a plush oval rug cradles a comfortable cushion bathed in golden sunlight streaming through a nearby window. Tom, a blue-gray cat with luminous yellow eyes, exhibits a complete cycle of feline behaviorâ€”from contentedly curling his tail around his body while half-dozing, to perking his ears attentively toward an unseen stimulus, then methodically stretching his front paws with an arched back before deliberately padding across the floor toward the kitchen. In the tiled kitchen with its white cabinetry, wooden table, and lace-curtained windows casting dappled light patterns, Tom's whiskers twitch inquisitively as he investigates the countertop where Jerry, a small brown mouse, sleeps peacefully atop a textured wedge of yellow cheese, his tiny body rising and falling with each breath.

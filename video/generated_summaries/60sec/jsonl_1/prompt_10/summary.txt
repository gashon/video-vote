The sun-drenched living room features a comfortable armchair by a window where Jerry, a brown mouse, sleeps peacefully through multiple subtle position changesâ€”his tiny body rising and falling with each breath, whiskers occasionally twitching, and his long tail dangling slightly over the cushion edge. Meanwhile, in the spacious kitchen with white tiled flooring, wooden cabinets, and natural light reflecting off clean countertops, Tom, the blue-gray cat, transitions from a bored slouch against a cabinet (where he examines his claws and taps his tail) to a full-body stretch before deliberately padding through a hallway adorned with framed pictures and a patterned runner carpet. Upon discovering the sleeping Jerry, Tom's ears perk with interest as he approaches silently, tilts his head contemplatively while his tail sways gently, then ultimately abandons his observation and returns to his original kitchen position, his paws making soft tapping sounds against the tiles.

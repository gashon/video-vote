The cozy living room features beige walls, hardwood flooring, and a large window with blue curtains filtering soft natural light that illuminates the entire space. Tom, a blue-gray cat with yellow eyes and twitching whiskers, reclines in a brown armchair, occasionally yawning to reveal his pink tongue and white teeth while methodically turning pages of a black-and-white newspaper, sometimes rubbing his eye from reading fatigue or crossing one leg over the other for comfort. Simultaneously, Jerry, a small brown mouse with delicate whiskers, sits on the nearby wooden side table with its smooth surface and curved edges, meticulously breaking off tiny morsels from a yellow, hole-filled cheese wedge on a small plate, occasionally freezing mid-bite to cautiously watch Tom whenever the cat lowers his newspaper, before resuming his meal with tiny paws bringing cheese to his mouth and eventually patting his belly contentedly.

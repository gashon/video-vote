The warm-toned living room features a comfortable brown couch against yellow walls, with a wooden coffee table positioned centrally and bookshelves lining the left wall, while a floor lamp casts soft illumination from the corner. Jerry, a small brown mouse with rounded ears, sits contentedly on the middle cushion, his tail curled beside him as he holds an open book in both paws, occasionally turning pages with his right paw and shifting the book to more comfortable angles while his eyes scan the text with focused attention. Tom, the blue-gray cat, enters through the doorway on the right, strolling unhurriedly across the room with a neutral expression, briefly making eye contact with Jerry—who momentarily looks up from his reading with slight surprise—before both exchange slow blinks of acknowledgment, after which Tom continues his casual pace toward the left doorway, pausing at the threshold to glance back once before exiting, allowing Jerry to return to his peaceful reading session.

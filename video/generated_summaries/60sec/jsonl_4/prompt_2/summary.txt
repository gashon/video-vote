In a sun-drenched living room with hardwood floors and beige walls, Tom, a blue-gray cat with yellow eyes, notices something from his armchair perch and investigates, his ears perking up as he stretches, descends to the floor, and walks deliberately toward the kitchen where Jerry, a brown mouse with twitching whiskers, stands on the counter savoring a piece of yellow cheese. Tom's stealthy journey is interrupted when he steps on a thick hardcover book in the cream-colored hallway, causing him to lose balance dramaticallyâ€”his paws splaying outward as he trips and falls chin-first onto the wooden floor while Jerry, hearing the commotion, turns toward the hallway entrance with his partially-eaten cheese still clutched in both paws. Defeated and slightly pained, Tom rubs his chin, nudges the offending book against the wall with one paw, and returns to the living room with hunched shoulders and drooping tail, where he jumps back onto his armchair, kneads the fabric briefly, turns in a small circle, and curls into a comfortable ball as the warm sunlight bathes his fur.

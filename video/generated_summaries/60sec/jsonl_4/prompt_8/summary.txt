In the warm, sun-dappled living room with polished wooden floors and beige walls, a blue-gray cat named Tom progresses through a sequence of deliberate actions, beginning with reading a book while comfortably positioned on a round cushion, his tail resting beside him and his paws delicately turning pages until he yawns and closes his book. Tom then executes a full-body stretch—front paws extended, back arched, tail pointing upward—before padding into the white-tiled kitchen with its checkered floor, where he meticulously selects a blue bowl from a cabinet, retrieves milk from the refrigerator (closing the door with his foot while balancing the bottle), and carefully pours the white liquid. Returning to the living room with measured steps to avoid spilling, Tom places the bowl beside his cushion, takes several sips with his pink tongue, and finally curls up into a peaceful slumber next to the half-empty bowl, his chest rising and falling rhythmically as the soft daylight continues filtering through the drawn curtains.

The warm, sunlit living room features beige walls and rich hardwood flooring with visible grain patterns, where Jerry, a brown mouse with twitching whiskers, meticulously consumes a yellow cheese wedge while sitting cross-legged, occasionally brushing crumbs from his rounded belly with his tiny paw. Across the room, Tom, a blue-gray cat with prominent whiskers and expressive yellow eyes, lies motionless on his stomach with paws tucked beneath his chest, alternating between intense focus and drooping eyelids as he vigilantly observes Jerry, his tail occasionally making subtle movements against the floor. Dust particles dance in the beams of sunlight filtering through the sheer curtains of the nearby window, casting a warm glow that highlights the plush armchair, central coffee table, and bookshelf positioned against the far wall, while the furniture appears larger from Tom's low vantage point on the floor.

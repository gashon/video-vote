The sun-drenched bedroom features soft yellow walls and rich wooden furniture, with blue curtains filtering golden light across the hardwood floor where Tom, a blue-gray cat with distinctive yellow eyes, and Jerry, a tiny brown mouse with delicate whiskers, sleep in unexpected harmony. Tom lies stretched out on his back with one paw draped across his chest, his fur catching the warm glow from the window, while Jerry remains curled into a tight ball on a small white pillow that shows subtle indentations from his minuscule weight. The peaceful scene is completed by the synchronized rise and fall of their breathing, with Tom's tail occasionally twitching in response to his dreams and Jerry's whiskers quivering slightly with each exhalation, as the afternoon shadows gradually lengthen across the floor beneath the wall-mounted clock on the large wooden dresser.

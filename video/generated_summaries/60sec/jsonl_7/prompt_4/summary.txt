In a warm-toned living room featuring an upholstered chair near a bookshelf, blue-gray Tom cat sits engrossed in reading, periodically turning pages, scratching his ear, crossing his legs, and yawning while remaining completely oblivious to activity elsewhere. Brown mouse Jerry emerges cautiously from his circular wall hole, whiskers twitching and ears perked alertly, before stealthily climbing the nearby wooden table to reach a plate containing yellow cheese. After carefully breaking off a small morsel with his paws, Jerry descends with his prize, pauses momentarily to glance back at the still-reading Tom, then successfully returns to his mouse hole with the cheese piece, leaving the living room scene exactly as peaceful as before his visit.

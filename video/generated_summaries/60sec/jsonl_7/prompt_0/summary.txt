The warmly-lit dining room features a polished rectangular wooden table centered on a muted-patterned area rug, surrounded by matching chairs, with curtained windows filtering natural sunlight along one wall. Tom, the blue-gray cat, initially watches intently as Jerry, the brown mouse, nibbles a yellow cheese piece with both paws on the table, but eventually abandons his surveillance, his tail swishing contemplatively before he retreats to a plush round cushion against the wall where he curls into a "cat loaf" position with half-closed eyes. Jerry finishes his meal down to the last morsel, leaving scattered crumbs on the wooden surface, patting his full belly with satisfaction as his whiskers twitch, while Tom drifts into a peaceful sleep on his cushion, chest rising and falling gently, completely disinterested in the mouse who now sits contentedly at the table's edge observing the slumbering cat.

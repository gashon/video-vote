In the warmly lit living room with pale yellow walls, Jerry the brown mouse sits attentively on a plump embroidered cushion, meticulously turning pages of his small book while occasionally running his tiny finger along text lines and chuckling at amusing passages. Tom the blue-gray cat progresses from cautiously peering through the doorway with perked ears and twitching whiskers to fully entering the room, his predatory gaze gradually softening to curiosity as he settles onto the deep-pile carpet several feet from the oblivious mouse. As afternoon sunlight streams through the curtained window creating elongated shadows, Tom fights a losing battle against drowsiness—his eyelids repeatedly drooping, head bobbing forward, and posture swaying dramatically—until he finally collapses into a slumped position with his tail curled around him, emitting soft snores while Jerry, now aware of Tom's presence, sets aside his bookmark-placed book with an amused smile.

The cozy living room features pale yellow walls and hardwood flooring, with a comfortable armchair positioned near a small wooden side table and a bookshelf against the far wall, all bathed in warm natural light streaming through curtained windows. Tom, a blue-gray cat with yellow eyes and twitching whiskers, sits in the armchair completely absorbed in reading a book with yellowed pages and a protruding bookmark, occasionally yawning, stretching, turning pages with his claw-tipped paw, and adjusting his seated position by crossing one leg over the other. Jerry, a brown mouse with wide curious eyes and twitching whiskers, emerges from his circular mouse hole (which has worn edges, tiny paw prints in the dust, and nearby scattered crumbs) to observe Tom, shielding his eyes with one paw for a better view, mimicking Tom's yawns while covering his mouth with his tiny paw, and eventually succumbing to drowsiness as he rests his head on the edge of his hole with closed eyes, having fallen asleep while watching the reading cat.

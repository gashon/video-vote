The warmly-lit bedroom features a soft bed with fluffy white pillows against the wall, complemented by a wooden nightstand holding a lamp and analog clock with a white face and black numbers that methodically ticks forward. Tom, the blue-gray cat with yellow eyes, sits on the wooden floor beside the bed, his posture gradually slouching and his eyelids growing increasingly heavy as he repeatedly yawns—revealing his pink tongue and white teeth—while periodically shifting his weight and flicking his tail against the floor. Meanwhile, Jerry, the small brown mouse, sleeps soundly on one of the pillows, his tiny body rising and falling with each breath, occasionally shifting positions, stretching his limbs, and even displaying a slight smile as he dreams, his whiskers twitching while Tom watches with a mixture of envy and resignation before finally succumbing to sleep himself, chin dropping to chest as his breathing deepens.

In the sunlit living room adorned with pastel blue walls, a wooden coffee table sits atop a patterned area rug, surrounded by a plush sofa, bookshelves filled with colorful spines, a floor lamp, and framed pictures near a fireplace, while delicate lace curtains filter soft natural light. Jerry, the brown mouse, remains completely absorbed in his book atop a small cushion on the coffee table, occasionally turning pages with his tiny paws, adjusting his position slightly, and even smiling at something he reads, his tail curled neatly beside him. Tom, the blue-gray cat with visible whiskers, fur texture gradients, and yellow eyes, enters from the left walking on all fours, freezes mid-room when he spots Jerry, his expression changing from casual to surprised with widened eyes and an "o"-shaped mouth, before he begins a theatrical retreat, lifting each paw with exaggerated caution in slow-motion tiptoeing, his body lowered and tail held perfectly still, temporarily freezing when Jerry stretches in a small yawn before continuing his silent exit through the doorway.

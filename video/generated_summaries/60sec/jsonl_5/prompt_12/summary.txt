The spacious kitchen features pristine white tiled floors and light blue walls, with wooden cabinets lining the perimeter and natural sunlight streaming through a large window above the sink. Tom, the blue-gray cat with yellow eyes and twitching whiskers, initially sits alert on the floor watching Jerry, but gradually succumbs to drowsiness—his head nodding, ears drooping, and eyes fluttering until he finally curls up on his side with a small bubble forming at his nose during deep slumber. Meanwhile, Jerry, the brown mouse with nimble paws, methodically enjoys a chocolate chip cookie from a white plate on the polished granite countertop—breaking off pieces, dipping some in the adjacent glass of milk, and eventually finishing his treat with a visible milk mustache before patting his full belly with a satisfied smile.

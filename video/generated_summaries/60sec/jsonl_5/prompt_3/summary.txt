The meticulously decorated living room features warm lighting that casts a golden hue across soft-colored walls, with lengthening shadows indicating late afternoon as confirmed by the wall clock, while sunlight streams through large windows with flowing curtains, creating distinct patterns on the carpeted floor. Jerry, the brown mouse, sits cross-legged on a round textured cushion beside a small reading lamp and tiny bookshelf, his whiskers twitching as he silently mouths words from his colorful illustrated book, occasionally stretching his arms or shifting position while turning pages with careful movements to avoid creasing the paper. Tom, the blue-gray cat, maintains a vigilant presence from his comfortable bed near the radiator, his yellow eyes blinking deliberately beneath ears that rotate slightly to catch the sound of turning pages, his blue-gray fur showing subtle color variations in the warm light, and his tail alternating between curling around his body and swaying slowly from side to side as he maintains his calm, patient observation.

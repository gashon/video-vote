The sunlit living room features plush carpeting, light-colored walls adorned with simple paintings, and a brick fireplace, all bathed in natural light filtering through partially drawn curtains. Tom, the blue-gray cat, sits drowsily on an armchair, his eyelids heavy and drooping as he watches Jerry with unusual disinterest, his tail hanging limply over the edge of the cushion. Jerry, the small brown mouse, sits confidently in the middle of the carpet holding a wedge of cheese that's slightly smaller than before due to the tiny bites he's been taking, occasionally glancing up at Tom while chewing slowly, his whiskers twitching with each bite in this rare moment of peaceful coexistence between the traditional enemies.

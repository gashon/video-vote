The meticulously maintained living room features honey-colored walls complemented by gleaming oak flooring that reflects the gentle sunlight streaming through a large multi-paned window, while a plush burgundy sofa with decorative throw pillows rests against the left wall beneath framed landscape paintings. Jerry, the small brown mouse with delicate whiskers and expressive eyes, sits cross-legged on a circular embroidered cushion with tasseled edges, deeply engrossed in a leather-bound book whose pages he turns with his tiny paws, occasionally nodding thoughtfully and curling his slender tail around the cushion's perimeter. Meanwhile, Tom, the lanky blue-gray cat with distinctive white chest fur and drooping whiskers, leans against the kitchen doorframe with increasingly heavy eyelids and a lazily hanging tail, until Jerry's sudden nose-wrinkling, eye-squeezing sneeze startles the cat from his near-slumber, causing Tom to jolt upright with widened eyes and raised hackles.

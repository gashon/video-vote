The immaculate kitchen features pristine white tiled flooring with subtle gray specks (including one tile with a visible crack) and calming light blue walls, while a solid wooden table with four chairs neatly tucked around it occupies the center of the space beneath a wall clock indicating mid-afternoon. Jerry, a brown mouse with twitching whiskers, sits cross-legged on the floor enjoying a piece of yellow cheese that he examines carefully, takes bites from with visibly puffed cheeks, and eventually finishes completely before patting his satisfied belly with crumb-free paws. Meanwhile, Tom, the blue-gray cat with occasionally twitching tail and whiskers, transitions from alertly watching Jerry with half-closed eyes from his round green cushion in the corner (near a small woven basket and air vent) to stretching with one paw toward the ceiling, rolling onto his back with paws up, and finally falling fully asleep with his chest rising and falling steadily and paws tucked under his body.

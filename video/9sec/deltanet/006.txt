The kitchen features cream-colored walls with light brown cabinets and a white marble countertop against the back wall. The floor is made of polished light brown tiles that reflect the overhead lighting. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on his hind legs on the kitchen counter, his tiny paws holding a large chocolate chip cookie that appears heavy in his grasp. The camera follows Jerry as he slowly turns toward the right side of the counter, then carefully descends to the floor using a dishcloth that hangs from the counter's edge, all while maintaining his grip on the cookie.<end_scene>

A matchbox bed with a cotton ball pillow sits against the back wall, and a thimble nightstand stands beside it. Tom, the blue-gray cat, sits on his haunches outside the mouse hole entrance on the left side of the frame, a smug grin spreading across his face. The camera remains fixed as Tom leans slightly forward, one paw resting on the floor while his tail sways gently from side to side in anticipation.

Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges from the left side of the frame into his bedroom, struggling to carry what appears to be a chocolate chip cookie. The camera zooms in slightly as Jerry places the cookie on the floor, revealing it to be a painted hockey puck that weighs down his tiny arms as he attempts to lift it again, his expression changing from joy to confusion.

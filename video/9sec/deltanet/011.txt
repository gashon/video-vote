A cozy kitchen with pale yellow walls and a dark wooden floor contains a wooden table in the center where a white teacup sits. Sunshine streams through a small window above the counter, casting a soft glow across the room. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands near the table, his whiskers twitching as he looks down at Jerry, the brown mouse, who is sleeping peacefully curled up inside the white teacup. The camera focuses on Tom's face as his eyes narrow with interest, then pans down to show his paw slowly placing a round chocolate chip cookie on the table beside the teacup as bait.

Sunshine streams through a small window above the counter, casting a soft glow across the room. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands hunched over the table with one paw raised above the teacup, while Jerry, the brown mouse, awakens inside the teacup, his eyes opening slowly as he notices both Tom and the cookie. The camera captures Jerry's perspective as he carefully slides the cookie directly under Tom's descending paw, moving the treat with both of his small paws while maintaining eye contact with the unaware cat.

Sunshine streams through a small window above the counter, casting a soft glow across the room. Tom, the blue-gray cat, has his paw pressed firmly down onto the table, his face showing growing confusion, while Jerry, the brown mouse, stands safely beside the teacup with a mischievous expression. The camera zooms in as Tom slowly lifts his paw to reveal his flattened fingers and the crushed cookie underneath, his eyes widening in pain and surprise while Jerry covers his mouth to suppress laughter.

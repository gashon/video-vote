The living room has a uniformly painted cream wall and polished wooden floor extending across the entire space. A small round table stands near the center of the room while a doorway is visible on the right wall.

The camera pans upward following Tom's trajectory as he becomes stuck to the ceiling, eyes wide with dismay, while below Jerry calmly picks up the cheese and takes a small bite, unaware of Tom's predicament above him.

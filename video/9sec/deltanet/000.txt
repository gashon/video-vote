A cozy living room with a beige wall and polished wooden floor. A large vase sits in the corner near a small mouse hole in the baseboard. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands in the center of the room, carefully tying a cookie to the end of a thin string, his posture hunched in concentration. The camera focuses on Tom's paws as he finishes securing the cookie to the string, then pans slightly to show Jerry, the brown mouse, peering cautiously from his hole in the wall, his eyes fixed on both Tom and the cookie.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, crouches behind the large vase, holding the other end of the string with the cookie dangling in the open area of the room. The camera remains steady as Tom's face displays a confident smirk while he waits patiently, his tail slowly swishing back and forth on the floor behind him.

A cozy living room with a beige wall and polished wooden floor. A large vase sits in the corner near a small mouse hole in the baseboard. Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains crouched behind the vase while Jerry, the brown mouse, stands partially visible behind Tom, pulling on the opposite end of the string. The camera captures the cookie as it moves along the string in Tom's direction instead of toward Jerry's hole, ending with the cookie gently swinging into Tom's surprised face as his expression shifts from confidence to confusion.

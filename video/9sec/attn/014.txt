The kitchen has cream-colored walls with light brown cabinets along the back wall and a polished white tile floor. A wooden table sits in the center of the room, while a small cat bed is positioned in the corner near the doorway. Tom, the blue-gray cat, lies curled up in his bed, sleeping peacefully with his tail stretched out behind him. Jerry, the brown mouse, approaches from the side carrying a yellow wedge of cheese, and gently places it on Tom's extended tail while the camera remains fixed on the scene.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The living room has pale yellow walls with framed pictures hanging on them and a plush beige carpet covering the floor. A large brown couch sits against the back wall, and a wooden coffee table is positioned in front of it. Tom, the blue-gray cat, enters through the doorway on the left side with a startled expression, the cheese wedge still attached to his tail as he moves.

The living room has pale yellow walls with framed pictures hanging on them and a plush beige carpet covering the floor. A large brown couch sits against the back wall, and a wooden coffee table is positioned in front of it. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands in the middle of the room looking nervous, while Spike, the gray dog, approaches from the right side of the frame, his nose pointed toward the cheese on Tom's tail. The camera pans slightly to capture both characters as Tom begins to back away from Spike, moving around the edge of the couch while the dog follows with his tongue hanging out.

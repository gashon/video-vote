The kitchen features white tiled floors and pale yellow walls with wooden cabinets lining the perimeter. A refrigerator stands prominently against the right wall, with a doorway visible on the left side of the room. Tom, the blue-gray cat, holds a thin paintbrush and carefully applies a clear, nearly invisible substance across the bottom of the kitchen doorway. The camera follows Tom as he completes painting the tripwire, then slowly backs away toward the refrigerator while holding both the paintbrush and a camera in his paws.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The living room has cream-colored walls and polished hardwood flooring with a round area rug in the center. A coffee table stands in the middle of the room, with a white ceramic bowl of milk placed near its edge. Jerry, the brown mouse, walks cautiously across the hardwood floor, approaching the doorway that leads to the kitchen. The camera remains stationary as Jerry reaches the doorway and his foot catches on the invisible tripwire, causing him to lose his balance and begin tumbling forward toward the bowl of milk.

The living room has cream-colored walls and polished hardwood flooring with a round area rug in the center. A coffee table stands in the middle of the room, with a white ceramic bowl of milk placed near its edge. Jerry, the brown mouse, is mid-tumble above the bowl, his arms and legs flailing, while Tom, the blue-gray cat, peeks around the doorframe from the kitchen with his camera raised. The camera captures the moment as Jerry splashes into the bowl of milk, creating a white fountain-like spray, while Tom presses the button on his camera, his face displaying a wide, satisfied grin.

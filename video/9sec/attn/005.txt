A bright kitchen with a wooden table stands in the center of the frame, with cream-colored walls and a tiled floor. A decorative blue vase filled with colorful flowers sits prominently on the table alongside a chocolate chip cookie. Tom, the blue-gray cat, approaches the table from the left side, his gaze fixed intently on the cookie resting on the tabletop. The camera remains steady as Tom slowly extends his paw toward the cookie, his body leaning forward with deliberate movement toward his target.

A decorative blue vase filled with colorful flowers sits prominently on the table alongside a chocolate chip cookie attached to a thin string. Jerry, the brown mouse, hides beneath the table, holding the other end of the string connected to the cookie, while Tom, the blue-gray cat, stretches his paw just above the cookie. The camera holds its position as Jerry gently pulls the string, causing the cookie to slide slowly away from Tom's reaching paw.

The camera captures Tom's expression changing from anticipation to surprise as his face makes contact with the vase of flowers, causing petals to scatter slightly across the table.

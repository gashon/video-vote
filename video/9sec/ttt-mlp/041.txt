The kitchen has a clean white tiled floor and pale yellow walls with wooden cabinets mounted along the back wall. A refrigerator stands on the left side, and a central wooden table occupies the middle of the room. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is carefully tying a thin string to a small silver fish that rests on the kitchen table. The camera captures Tom from a side angle as he finishes securing the knot, then slowly picks up the other end of the string and walks toward the kitchen doorway.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The living room features beige walls and a polished wooden floor with a large rectangular rug in the center. A brown sofa sits against the back wall, and a small round coffee table is positioned in front of it. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is crouched behind the sofa with only his eyes and the top of his head visible, holding the end of a string that extends across the floor toward the kitchen doorway. The camera shows a wide shot of the room as Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges from a mouse hole in the baseboard and approaches the fish bait lying on the floor near the kitchen entrance.

The living room features beige walls and a polished wooden floor with a large rectangular rug in the center. A brown sofa sits against the back wall, and a small round coffee table is positioned in front of it. Jerry, the brown mouse, has the fish in his paws while Tom, the blue-gray cat, pulls the string from behind the sofa, causing Jerry to slide across the floor toward a sleeping Spike, the gray dog, who rests beside his water bowl. The camera follows Jerry's path as he travels across the floor and lands with a gentle splash in Spike's water bowl, causing the dog to slowly open his eyes with a low growl.

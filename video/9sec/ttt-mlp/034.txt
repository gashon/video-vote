The kitchen features cream-colored walls with light brown cabinets along the back wall and a tiled floor in beige. A wooden rectangular table stands prominently in the center of the room, with a small piece of cheese placed on its surface. Jerry, the brown mouse, is positioned on the table next to the cheese, carefully tying a thin string around the cheese with his small paws. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is curled up on a round cushion in the corner of the kitchen, his eyes closed as he naps peacefully. The camera shows Jerry from a side angle as he completes tying the string and then holds the end of it while looking toward the sleeping Tom.

The kitchen features cream-colored walls with light brown cabinets along the back wall and a tiled floor in beige. A wooden rectangular table stands prominently in the center of the room, with a small piece of cheese placed on its surface. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is now awake and standing beside the table, his eyes fixed on the cheese, while Jerry, the brown mouse, hides under the table holding the end of the string attached to the cheese. The camera follows Tom as he slowly reaches his paw toward the cheese, only for Jerry to pull the string, causing the cheese to slide toward the door that leads to the garden.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The garden outside features a lush green lawn, colorful flower beds along the edges, and a brick path cutting through the middle. A middle-aged man wearing overalls and a straw hat stands on the path, holding a metal watering can in his hands. Tom, the blue-gray cat, comes crashing through the half-open wooden door, landing on his stomach on the brick path with a surprised expression. The camera captures the gardener's startled reaction as he accidentally tilts the watering can, pouring a steady stream of water directly onto Tom's head while the cat blinks in confusion.

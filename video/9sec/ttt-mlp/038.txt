A cozy living room with cream-colored walls and polished wooden flooring contains a small wooden table near the center. A large potted plant sits in the corner, and a decorative vase stands on a shelf to the right. Tom, the blue-gray cat, carefully balances a plate of cheese on top of a precariously placed book on the wooden table, forming a simple trap. The camera captures Tom from the side as he methodically arranges the trap, adjusting the book's position with deliberate precision while occasionally glancing toward the mouse hole in the baseboard.

A large potted plant sits in the corner, and a decorative vase stands on a shelf to the right. Tom, the blue-gray cat, crouches behind the decorative vase on the shelf, his whiskers and eyes barely visible as he watches the trap he set. The camera pans slowly to the left as Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges from his hole in the baseboard and approaches the table, his nose twitching at the scent of cheese while Tom's eyes narrow with anticipation.

A large potted plant sits in the corner, and a decorative vase stands on a shelf to the right. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on his hind legs on the table, holding a piece of cheese while the book snaps shut beside him. The camera widens to show Tom, the blue-gray cat, whose whiskers are painfully caught in the snapped book, his eyes crossed in pain and surprise as Jerry casually takes a bite of cheese with a satisfied expression.

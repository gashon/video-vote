The living room features a comfortable beige couch against a pale yellow wall, with a wooden coffee table in front on a light brown carpeted floor. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is sleeping deeply on the couch, his body stretched out with his tail hanging over the edge.

<start_scene>The kitchen has white tiled floors, cream-colored walls, and wooden cabinets along the perimeter with a large refrigerator on the right side. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is just waking up, stretching his limbs as he stands on all fours near the kitchen entrance, while Jerry, the brown mouse, scurries across the counter on the opposite side.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, is walking toward Jerry, the brown mouse, who stands near the refrigerator, while the string attached to Tom's tail is now visibly connected to the refrigerator door handle. The camera remains stationary as Tom continues forward, the string pulls taut causing the refrigerator door to swing open, and a glass bottle of milk tips over from inside, slowly descending onto Tom's head with a gentle thud.

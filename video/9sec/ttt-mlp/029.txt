A simple living room with a light beige wall and polished wooden floor contains a small round table against the wall. Near the center of the room is a flowered vase, and to the right is a mouse hole in the baseboard. Tom, the blue-gray cat, crouches behind the vase, holding a string with a fish attached at the end, carefully dangling it above Jerry's mouse hole. The camera shows Tom from the side as he slowly licks his lips while his paw steadily holds the string, his eyes fixed intently on the mouse hole where he expects Jerry to emerge.

Near the center of the room is a flowered vase, and to the right is a mouse hole in the baseboard. Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains behind the vase, now showing signs of impatience as his free paw taps against the floor while the fish continues to dangle from the string above the mouse hole. The camera captures Tom's face in a medium shot as his expression shifts from anticipation to frustration, his grip on the string gradually loosening as he shifts his weight from one paw to another.

Near the center of the room is a flowered vase, and to the right is a mouse hole in the baseboard. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is still positioned behind the vase, but now appears startled as the fish and string slip from his grasp. The camera pulls back slightly to show the fish swinging backward in an arc and slapping directly into Tom's face with a wet impact, leaving him cross-eyed and dazed, while Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks out from his hole with a paw covering his mouth as he giggles.

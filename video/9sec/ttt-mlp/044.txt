<start_scene>A cozy living room with light beige walls and a polished wooden floor. A large, plush red cushion sits in the center of the room on a small circular rug. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is crouched low, carefully tiptoeing from the left side of the frame toward the center where Jerry, the brown mouse, is peacefully sleeping on the cushion. The camera follows Tom's slow, deliberate movement as he extends his arms forward, holding a clear drinking glass between his paws while his eyes remain fixed on the sleeping Jerry.

A cozy living room with light beige walls and a polished wooden floor. A large, plush red cushion sits in the center of the room on a small circular rug. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is now positioned right beside the cushion, carefully lowering the clear drinking glass over Jerry, the brown mouse, who begins to stir from his sleep. The camera remains stationary as Jerry slowly opens his eyes and stretches his tiny arms upward, immediately bumping his head against the glass ceiling that Tom has placed over him.

A cozy living room with light beige walls and a polished wooden floor. A large, plush red cushion sits in the center of the room on a small circular rug. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands beside the cushion with a satisfied grin, watching as Jerry, the brown mouse, pushes against the glass barrier with his paws. The camera pulls back slightly to capture the full scene as the cushion suddenly deflates with a slow hiss, propelling the glass upward in a gentle arc before it descends perfectly onto Tom's head, covering it completely.

The living room features a tan-colored sofa against a light beige wall, with a wooden coffee table in the center and a warm-toned carpet covering the floor. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands next to Spike, the gray dog, who is sleeping peacefully on a round dog bed near the sofa. The camera follows Jerry as he carefully ties one end of a thin string to Spike's collar, then turns and moves toward Tom's direction, holding the other end of the string.

The living room features a tan-colored sofa against a light beige wall, with a wooden coffee table in the center and a warm-toned carpet covering the floor. Jerry, the brown mouse, approaches Tom, the blue-gray cat, who is walking toward the kitchen doorway with his tail swishing behind him.

<start_scene>The kitchen has cream-colored walls, white tiled flooring, and wooden cabinets along the back wall, with a small round table in the corner and a bowl of milk placed on the floor. Tom, the blue-gray cat, walks toward the milk bowl, unaware of the string attached to his tail that stretches back through the doorway. The camera pans slightly to capture Tom's surprised expression as the string pulls taut, and Spike, the gray dog, appears in the doorway with an annoyed growl, being dragged by the string connected to Tom's tail.

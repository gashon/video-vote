The living room features a cozy beige sofa against a cream-colored wall, with a wooden coffee table positioned in front of it. A large window with open curtains allows sunlight to stream in from the right side of the room. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on the sofa cushion with a single chocolate chip cookie in his paws, carefully placing it on a concealed spring mechanism. The camera focuses on Jerry as he gently pushes the cookie into position and then scurries behind the armrest of the sofa, his face showing anticipation.

The living room features a cozy beige sofa against a cream-colored wall, with a wooden coffee table positioned in front of it. A large window with open curtains allows sunlight to stream in from the right side of the room. Tom, the blue-gray cat, walks slowly toward the sofa, his attention immediately drawn to the cookie resting on the cushion, while Jerry, the brown mouse, peers from behind the armrest. The camera follows Tom as he approaches the sofa and carefully lowers himself onto the cushion where the cookie was placed, triggering the spring mechanism which launches the cookie upward toward the open window.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The garden outside features a lush green lawn with colorful flower beds along a stone path, all set against the exterior wall of the house with the open window visible above. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on a flat garden stone with his paws extended upward, looking expectantly at the sky. The camera pans upward to show the cookie arcing gracefully through the air from the window, then back down to Jerry who catches the cookie perfectly in his outstretched paws and hugs it to his chest with a satisfied expression.

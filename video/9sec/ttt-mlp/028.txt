The kitchen has a white tiled floor and cream-colored walls with wooden cabinets lining the background. A small round table sits in the center with a bowl of fruit on it. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is curled up asleep on the floor near the refrigerator, his tail stretched out flat on the floor. Jerry, the brown mouse, approaches Tom's tail carefully, holding a large chocolate chip cookie above it with both paws. The camera follows Jerry as he gently places the cookie on Tom's tail, balancing it vertically with slow, deliberate movements before backing away a few steps.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The kitchen has a white tiled floor and cream-colored walls with wooden cabinets lining the background. A small round table sits in the center with a bowl of fruit on it. Tom, the blue-gray cat, opens his eyes wide and lifts his head, noticing the weight on his tail, while Jerry, the brown mouse, stands a short distance away watching. The camera remains stationary as Tom slowly turns his head to look at his tail, then at Jerry, his expression changing from sleepy confusion to alertness as he rises to all fours, causing the cookie to wobble precariously.

The living room features beige walls with framed pictures and a polished wooden floor. A glass vase sits prominently on a side table near the center of the room, with a doorway visible on the left side. Tom, the blue-gray cat, walks through the doorway with his paws outstretched toward Jerry, the brown mouse, who moves ahead of him along the floor. The camera captures Tom's forward motion as he bumps into the side table, causing him to lose balance and fall backward while the vase wobbles and the cookie arcs through the air, landing directly in Tom's open mouth as he sits sprawled on the floor.

The kitchen features a uniformly painted light yellow wall and a clean white tiled floor. A wooden counter runs along the back wall, and a small round table sits in the center of the room. Jerry, the brown mouse, crouches near the center of the kitchen floor, holding the end of a thin string that extends upward to a white ceramic bowl positioned on the edge of the counter. The camera remains static as Jerry slowly pulls the string downward with both paws, causing the bowl to gradually tilt forward, spilling white milk that flows across the counter and drips onto the floor.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The living room has a uniformly painted beige wall and a polished wooden floor with a small green rug in the center. A tall wooden cabinet with a decorative blue vase sits against the right wall, while a doorway to the kitchen is visible on the left. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands on all fours near the doorway, his whiskers twitching and tail raised in an alert position. The camera pans slightly to follow Tom as he walks forward with deliberate steps toward the center of the room, his gaze fixed on Jerry, the brown mouse, who scurries away toward the right side of the frame.

The living room has a uniformly painted beige wall and a polished wooden floor with a small green rug in the center. A tall wooden cabinet with a decorative blue vase sits against the right wall, while a doorway to the kitchen is visible on the left. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is mid-stride in the center of the room, his front paw stepping onto a puddle of white milk that has flowed beneath the kitchen door. The camera remains stationary as Tom's paws slide forward on the slippery milk, causing his body to tilt backward while his limbs stretch outward, before he slides directly into the wooden cabinet, causing the blue vase to wobble.

The kitchen has clean white walls and a polished checkered black and white floor. A wooden rectangular table sits in the center of the room, with four matching chairs neatly arranged around it. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on the kitchen table next to a large chocolate chip cookie that is twice his size. The camera follows Jerry as he carefully lifts the cookie with both paws, a smug expression on his face, and slowly walks to the edge of the table toward a small mouse hole visible in the baseboard of the wall.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The living room has beige walls with a decorative border running horizontally at waist height and a light brown wooden floor throughout. A green sofa sits against the back wall, and a small round end table with a lamp stands in the corner. Tom, the blue-gray cat, sits on his haunches next to a mouse hole in the baseboard, with a mousetrap placed directly in front of the hole, baited with the same chocolate chip cookie. The camera captures Tom from a side angle as he watches the mouse hole intently, his tail swishing slowly back and forth across the wooden floor.

The living room has beige walls with a decorative border running horizontally at waist height and a light brown wooden floor throughout. A green sofa sits against the back wall, and a small round end table with a lamp stands in the corner. Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges halfway from a second mouse hole in the baseboard, about three feet away from where Tom is waiting. The camera zooms in slightly as Jerry's expression changes from confident to shocked upon seeing Tom, the blue-gray cat, sitting beside the mousetrap with the cookie bait, while Tom's mouth curves into a satisfied grin.

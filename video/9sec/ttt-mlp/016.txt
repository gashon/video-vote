The living room has a uniformly painted beige wall and polished wooden floor. A brown sofa sits against the wall in the background, and a small round coffee table occupies the center of the room. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands in the middle of the living room holding a string with a fish attached to the end. The camera follows Tom as he carefully places the fish on the floor, letting the string trail behind him as he walks slowly toward the corner of the room.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, is positioned behind the corner of the room, holding the end of the string, with a triumphant smirk on his face. The camera shifts to capture Jerry, the brown mouse, as he emerges from a small hole in the baseboard and approaches the fish bait with cautious steps, his whiskers twitching with interest.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The kitchen has light yellow walls and black and white checkered floor tiles. A wooden table stands in the center while cabinets and a sink line the back wall. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands with a broom held in both paws, while Jerry, the brown mouse, is being pulled into the kitchen by the string attached to the fish he holds. The camera remains stationary as Jerry slides across the floor toward Tom, who lifts the broom slightly in anticipation, his eyes narrowing with satisfaction.

The living room has a uniformly painted cream-colored wall and a polished wooden floor. A large red armchair sits against the wall with a small side table next to it. Tom, the blue-gray cat, lies curled up on the armchair, his eyes closed and tail hanging over the edge. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on tiptoes near the armchair, holding a large chocolate chip cookie in his paws. The camera focuses on Jerry as he slowly approaches Tom's hanging tail and gently tucks the cookie into the fur at the end of the tail.

The living room has a uniformly painted cream-colored wall and a polished wooden floor. A large red armchair sits against the wall with a small side table next to it. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is now awake on the armchair, arching his back in a stretch with his cookie-laden tail still hanging unnoticed. The camera follows Tom as he rises from the armchair and begins walking at a leisurely pace toward the doorway on the right, leaving a visible trail of cookie crumbs falling from his tail.

<start_scene>The kitchen has white-tiled walls and a checkered black and white floor. A refrigerator stands against the far wall with cabinets lining the sides. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands in the center of the kitchen looking confused, while three small brown mice emerge from a mouse hole in the baseboard. The wide-angle camera captures the entire scene as the mice follow the cookie crumb trail directly to Tom, who looks down at his tail and notices the partially crumbled cookie with an expression of surprise and embarrassment.

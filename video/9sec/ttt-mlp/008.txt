A living room has a beige wall with a small window and polished wooden floor. A small table stands in the background, while a cushion rests on the floor in the foreground. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands in the center of the room balancing a glass of milk carefully on top of his head, his paws extended outward for stability. The camera captures Tom from a slight side angle as he maintains a focused expression, deliberately holding his posture still while the glass of milk remains balanced precariously on his head.

A living room has a beige wall with a small window and polished wooden floor. A small table stands in the background, while a cushion rests on the floor in the foreground. Tom, the blue-gray cat, continues to balance the glass of milk on his head in the center of the room, while Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges from behind the cushion in the foreground. The camera frames both characters as Jerry positions himself next to the cushion, puts his paws to his mouth, and whistles loudly toward Tom, causing the cat to look surprised while still maintaining his balancing act.

A living room has a beige wall with a small window and polished wooden floor. A small table stands in the background, while a cushion rests on the floor in the foreground. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is startled and begins to lose his balance, the glass of milk tilting on his head, while Jerry, the brown mouse, watches from beside the cushion. The camera follows Tom as he stumbles backward, the milk spilling down his face and chest, then lands seated on the cushion with an initial look of relief that slowly transforms into an annoyed expression directed at Jerry.

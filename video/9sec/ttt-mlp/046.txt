A brightly lit kitchen with cream-colored walls and wooden flooring features a tall wooden cabinet against the back wall. A wooden chair is positioned in front of the cabinet, directly beneath a high shelf containing a jar of cookies. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is standing on his hind legs on the wooden chair, stretching his upper body to reach the cookie jar on the high shelf. The camera captures Tom from a side angle as he extends his arm upward, his paw barely reaching the edge of the cookie jar while he maintains a precarious balance on the chair.

A wooden chair is positioned in front of the cabinet, directly beneath a high shelf containing a jar of cookies. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is standing on tiptoes on the chair with one paw finally grasping a cookie from the jar, while Jerry, the brown mouse, watches secretly from behind a nearby sugar container on the counter. The camera focuses on Tom's face showing anticipation as he slowly brings the cookie toward his mouth, unaware that Jerry has replaced the bottom cookie with a paper cutout.

The camera zooms in slightly on Tom's face as his expression transforms from initial satisfaction to bewilderment, his eyes widening and his whiskers drooping as he realizes he's bitten into nothing but air.

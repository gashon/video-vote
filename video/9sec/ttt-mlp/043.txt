A small living room with cream-colored walls and a wooden floor features a round blue vase positioned next to a small mousehole in the right wall. The room is bathed in soft afternoon light coming from a window off-screen to the left. Tom, the blue-gray cat, crouches behind the vase holding a fishing rod with a plump silver fish tied to the end of the string. The camera frames Tom in profile as he extends the fishing rod slowly, deliberately positioning the dangling fish directly in front of the mousehole while a smug grin spreads across his face.

The room is bathed in soft afternoon light coming from a window off-screen to the left. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is leaning forward from behind the vase, his neck stretched out as he peers towards the mousehole with the fishing rod still in his paws. The camera stays fixed as Tom shifts his weight forward gradually to get a better look at the mousehole, causing the vase behind him to wobble slightly and begin tilting toward him.

The room is bathed in soft afternoon light coming from a window off-screen to the left. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is caught mid-tumble as the blue vase falls completely over, with his paws flailing in the air and his face headed directly toward the dangling fish. The camera captures the moment as Tom's face connects with the fish with a solid impact, the fishing line wrapping around his neck while the vase rolls to a stop beside him on the wooden floor.

A cozy living room with cream-colored walls and a polished wooden floor. A round blue vase sits on a small wooden table near the center of the room, and a decorative rug lies beneath the furniture. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is positioned behind the vase, holding a small fish tied to a thin string, dangling it carefully in view. The camera captures Tom as he crouches low with a confident smirk on his face, slowly swinging the fish left to right while occasionally peering around the vase to check if Jerry has noticed his trap.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains behind the vase while Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges cautiously from a small mouse hole in the baseboard, his attention fixed on the dangling fish. The camera widens slightly to include both characters as Jerry takes a few tentative steps toward the fish, and Tom prepares his stance, his muscles tensing in anticipation for his upcoming pounce.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, lunges forward with outstretched paws toward Jerry, the brown mouse, who quickly dodges to the side with the fish. The camera follows Tom's movement as he misses his target completely and collides with the vase, causing it to tip over and trap him inside with only his tail visible, while Jerry sits nearby, contentedly nibbling on his newfound meal.

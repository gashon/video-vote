A cozy living room with beige walls and polished wooden floor contains a large round cushion in the center, positioned on a small area rug. A ray of afternoon sunlight streams through a nearby window, illuminating dust particles in the air. Tom, the blue-gray cat, approaches the cushion with heavy-lidded eyes, his tail drooping slightly behind him. The camera captures Tom as he slowly stretches his front paws forward and gradually lowers his body onto the cushion, unaware of the small wedge of yellow cheese that Jerry, the brown mouse, has deliberately placed underneath one edge.

A ray of afternoon sunlight streams through a nearby window, illuminating dust particles in the air. Tom, the blue-gray cat, lies sprawled across the cushion, his eyes closed and chest rising and falling with each breath. The camera zooms in slightly as Tom's weight causes the cushion to compress further, gradually forcing the wedge of yellow cheese to slide outward from beneath the cushion's edge until it becomes fully visible on the floor.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains asleep on the cushion while Jerry, the brown mouse, stands near a mouse hole with another small brown mouse who has just emerged from beneath a nearby cabinet. The camera pans slowly as the second mouse tiptoes forward, carefully grasps the cheese with both paws, and begins to drag it backward toward Jerry, causing a slight tugging motion that makes the cushion shift just enough to wake Tom, whose eyes open wide just in time to see the two mice retreating with their prize.

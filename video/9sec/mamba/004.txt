The kitchen features cream-colored walls with white-tiled flooring and a large wooden counter positioned against the back wall. A small round plate with cookies sits on the edge of the counter, and cabinets hang above it against the wall. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on the kitchen counter next to the cookie plate, his tiny paws gripping a chocolate chip cookie nearly as big as himself. The camera follows Jerry as he slowly walks to the edge of the counter with his prize, glancing over his shoulder cautiously while a partially visible Tom, the blue-gray cat, approaches from the left side of the frame.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A section of wall in the living room displays a light beige paint job with a small, perfectly round mouse hole visible in the lower portion. The wooden baseboard runs horizontally along the bottom of the wall, framing the mouse hole. Jerry, the brown mouse, scurries toward his hole with the cookie clutched in his paws, while Tom, the blue-gray cat, extends his paw forward in an attempt to catch the mouse. The camera remains fixed on the wall as Jerry slips through the mouse hole with his cookie, and Tom's momentum carries him forward until his face makes contact with the wall beside the hole.

The interior of Jerry's mouse hole reveals a cozy, miniature living space with tiny furniture, warm amber lighting, and smooth dirt walls reinforced with small wooden beams. A small round table sits in the center of the room, with a matchbox bed visible in the background against the far wall. Jerry, the brown mouse, sits comfortably in a thimble chair at his table, holding the chocolate chip cookie that's nearly as large as he is. The camera maintains a steady position showing Jerry taking a deliberate bite of his cookie, his expression displaying satisfaction as crumbs fall onto the tiny table in front of him.

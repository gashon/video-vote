A cozy living room has a uniformly painted cream wall and a wooden floor with a large round cushion in the center. A small side table stands nearby, and warm sunlight filters through a window on the left wall. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands at the edge of the room, his eyes fixed on Jerry, the brown mouse, who is curled up asleep on the round cushion. The camera shows Tom's expression changing from surprise to mischief as he spots the sleeping mouse, then follows as Tom begins to tiptoe slowly toward Jerry, his paws carefully placed to minimize noise.

A cozy living room has a uniformly painted cream wall and a wooden floor with a large round cushion in the center. A small side table stands nearby, and warm sunlight filters through a window on the left wall. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is now halfway across the room, hunched over in a sneaking position with an empty glass tumbler held carefully in his right paw. The camera maintains a steady position, capturing Tom as he continues his deliberate tiptoeing toward the cushion where Jerry, the brown mouse, remains peacefully asleep, with Jerry's tiny chest rising and falling with each breath.

A cozy living room has a uniformly painted cream wall and a wooden floor with a large round cushion in the center. A small side table stands nearby, and warm sunlight filters through a window on the left wall. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is positioned directly over the cushion, arms extended downward with the glass tumbler nearly touching Jerry, the brown mouse, who suddenly stretches his limbs in his sleep. The camera angle widens slightly to show Tom freezing in an awkward bent position, his arms beginning to tremble visibly before he loses balance and falls forward, landing face-first onto the cushion as Jerry's eyes pop open in surprise.

The living room has a plain beige wall and a polished wooden floor that spans the entire space. A plush red cushion sits in the center of the room, positioned on a small circular rug. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands at the doorway, his eyes fixed intently on the cushion where Jerry, the brown mouse, is sleeping peacefully. The camera follows Tom as he carefully tiptoes toward the cushion, deliberately placing each paw to minimize noise while holding a wooden broom firmly in his right paw.

The living room has a plain beige wall and a polished wooden floor that spans the entire space. A plush red cushion sits in the center of the room, positioned on a small circular rug. Tom, the blue-gray cat, now stands directly over the cushion with the wooden broom raised high above his head, while Jerry, the brown mouse, begins to stir and open his eyes. The camera captures Jerry as he becomes aware of the looming threat and slowly slides sideways off the cushion, while Tom's face shows a triumphant grin as he prepares to bring the broom down.

The living room has a plain beige wall and a polished wooden floor that spans the entire space. A plush red cushion sits in the center of the room, positioned on a small circular rug. Tom, the blue-gray cat, swings the wooden broom downward and hits only the empty cushion, causing him to lose balance and rotate halfway around. The camera pulls back slightly to show Tom's complete motion as he wobbles unsteadily on his feet before falling forward in slow motion, landing face-first on the wooden floor with his legs splayed behind him.

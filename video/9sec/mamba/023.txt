A bright kitchen with cream-colored walls and polished wood flooring features a wooden counter along the back wall. A blue cookie jar sits on top of a high shelf mounted on the wall. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands carefully atop a precariously balanced stack of five hardcover books of various colors, his body stretched upward. The camera captures Tom from a side angle as he slowly extends his right paw toward the cookie jar, his eyes fixed intently on his target while his body trembles slightly from the unstable foundation.

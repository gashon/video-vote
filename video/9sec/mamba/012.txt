The kitchen has cream-colored walls with wooden cabinets lining the background and a smooth tiled floor in light beige. A small round table sits in the center with a cookie placed on its surface. Jerry, the brown mouse, crouches behind the table leg, holding one end of a thin string that is tied to the cookie on the table. The camera remains fixed as Tom, the blue-gray cat, slowly approaches the table from the left side of the frame, his eyes focused intently on the cookie.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The backyard is covered in fresh white snow with a large oak tree visible in the background against a pale blue winter sky. A wooden pet door is visible in the bottom portion of the house wall on the left side of the frame. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is partially emerging from the pet door headfirst, with his front paws extended forward and a look of surprise on his face. The camera captures the moment as Tom continues to be pulled through the small pet door opening, the cookie still clutched in his paw with the string trailing behind him.

The backyard is covered in fresh white snow with a large oak tree visible in the background against a pale blue winter sky. A wooden pet door is visible in the bottom portion of the house wall on the left side of the frame. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is flying through the air with his body fully extended, the cookie still in his paw and a string trailing behind him. The camera follows Tom's trajectory as he soars through the air and collides face-first with a three-tiered snowman standing in the center of the yard, causing snow to gently puff around the impact point.

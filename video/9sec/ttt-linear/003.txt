A spacious living room with a cream-colored wall and polished wooden floor contains a round wooden table in the center. A large blue ceramic vase stands near the left side of the room, its intricate patterns clearly visible. Tom, the blue-gray cat, crouches low behind the vase, his body partially hidden while his green eyes peer intently at the table. The camera captures Tom's whiskers twitching slightly as he focuses on Jerry, the brown mouse, who sits contentedly on the tabletop beside a wedge of yellow cheese.

A spacious living room with a cream-colored wall and polished wooden floor contains a round wooden table in the center. A large blue ceramic vase stands near the left side of the room, its intricate patterns clearly visible. Tom, the blue-gray cat, emerges from behind the vase and moves deliberately toward the table where Jerry, the brown mouse, continues to nibble on his cheese. The camera follows Tom as he slowly extends his paws forward to grab Jerry, but his whiskers bend against his pink nose, causing his expression to change to one of discomfort.

A spacious living room with a cream-colored wall and polished wooden floor contains a round wooden table in the center. A large blue ceramic vase stands near the left side of the room, its intricate patterns clearly visible. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands with his face scrunched up in a pre-sneeze expression, his body tensed near the table while Jerry, the brown mouse, still holds his cheese piece. The camera captures the moment as Tom releases a powerful sneeze that propels Jerry and his cheese gently through the air toward the right side of the room, while Tom's momentum carries him forward onto the now-empty tabletop.

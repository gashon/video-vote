The living room has a uniformly painted beige wall with a wooden bookshelf against it, and a polished wooden floor that extends across the entire space. A half-open door is visible on the right side of the frame, leading to the kitchen. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands on a small stool next to the door, his paws carefully holding a glass fishbowl filled with water. The camera remains static as Tom slowly positions the fishbowl on top of the slightly ajar door, balancing it precariously with deliberate movements while glancing downward with a mischievous expression.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The kitchen has white tiled floors and pale yellow walls with cabinets mounted above a counter along the back wall. A refrigerator stands on the left side, and the door connecting to the living room is visible on the left edge of the frame. Jerry, the brown mouse, walks casually across the kitchen floor toward the door, unaware of any trap. The camera follows Jerry from behind as he approaches the door and reaches up to push it open wider, his small paw making contact with the wooden surface.

The kitchen has white tiled floors and pale yellow walls with cabinets mounted above a counter along the back wall. A refrigerator stands on the left side, and the door connecting to the living room is visible on the left edge of the frame. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands completely drenched in the center of the floor, water dripping from his entire body, while a small orange fish flops atop his head. The camera captures Jerry's wide-eyed expression of shock as he remains motionless in a puddle of water, his whiskers drooping down while the fish's tail gently slaps against his forehead.

The kitchen has cream-colored walls with wooden cabinets lining the back and a tiled floor in light beige. A window on the right wall allows sunlight to stream in, illuminating the central area. Tom, the blue-gray cat, lies stretched out on the kitchen floor, his eyes closed in peaceful slumber with his tail extended behind him. The camera focuses on Jerry, the brown mouse, as he carefully approaches Tom's tail, delicately balancing a round chocolate chip cookie in his tiny paws while moving with deliberate, cautious steps.

The kitchen has cream-colored walls with wooden cabinets lining the back and a tiled floor in light beige. A window on the right wall allows sunlight to stream in, illuminating the central area. Tom, the blue-gray cat, suddenly awakens with widened eyes as his tail vibrates slightly with the weight of the cookie, causing his body to tense. The camera pulls back slightly to capture the full scene as Tom's tail instinctively flicks upward, launching the cookie in a smooth arc toward the open window, while Jerry, the brown mouse, remains frozen in place with his paws still positioned as if holding the cookie.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The garden outside has lush green grass with colorful flowers dotting the landscape and a clear blue sky above. A small bird with bright yellow feathers sits perched on a low branch of a nearby bush, its head tilted in curiosity. The camera follows the cookie's gentle arc through the air as it travels through the window, then focuses on the yellow bird as it pushes off from its perch and glides forward with wings extended, catching the cookie midair while Tom's angry face and Jerry's sheepish expression are partially visible through the window frame.

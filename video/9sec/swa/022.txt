The kitchen features a uniformly painted cream wall and a checkered black and white floor tile that extends across the entire space. A rectangular wooden table stands in the center of the room with a plate containing a whole fish placed on top, and a large glass milk bottle sits open on the floor nearby.

The camera provides a wider view of the scene as Jerry, the brown mouse, sits comfortably on the edge of the plate, taking small bites of the fish while occasionally glancing toward the trapped Tom.

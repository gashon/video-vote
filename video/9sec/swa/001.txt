A kitchen with light yellow walls and white tile flooring features wooden cabinets and a high shelf mounted on the wall. A round wooden table with a blue milk bowl sits in the foreground, and a cookie jar is positioned on the top shelf. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands carefully atop a wobbling stack of three large books that he has arranged on the kitchen floor. The camera shows Tom from the side as he stretches his paw slowly upward toward the cookie jar, his body visibly straining with the effort while he maintains his balance on the unsteady book tower.

Tom, the blue-gray cat, remains precariously balanced on the stack of books while Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges from behind the table leg and approaches the book tower. The camera captures Jerry as he slowly reaches for the bottom book and deliberately pulls it outward, causing the entire stack to tilt and begin collapsing as Tom's expression shifts from concentration to alarm.

A round wooden table with a blue milk bowl sits in the foreground, and a cookie jar is positioned on the top shelf. Tom, the blue-gray cat, falls forward with his arms outstretched as the books topple beneath him, while Jerry, the brown mouse, holds a cookie in his paws. The camera remains stationary as Tom lands face-first into the blue milk bowl with a splash, his rear end pointed upward, while Jerry walks away to the right side of the frame with the cookie, turning his head to display a satisfied grin.

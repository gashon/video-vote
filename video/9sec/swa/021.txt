The kitchen has cream-colored walls with white cabinets lining the perimeter and a checkered black and white tile floor. A wooden table with four matching chairs sits in the center of the room, and a counter with various cooking utensils runs along the back wall. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on the edge of the table holding a small thumbtack, watching the doorway with anticipation. The camera remains fixed as Jerry carefully places the thumbtack, pointy side up, on the seat of one chair, then scurries to hide behind a salt shaker as Tom, the blue-gray cat, slowly enters the frame from the left carrying a bowl of milk.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The kitchen has cream-colored walls with white cabinets lining the perimeter and a checkered black and white tile floor. A wooden table with four matching chairs sits in the center of the room, and a counter with various cooking utensils runs along the back wall. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands beside the chair with the hidden thumbtack, holding a bowl of milk steadily in both paws. The camera angle shifts slightly upward as Tom slowly lowers himself onto the chair, his face instantly transforming from calm to shocked as the thumbtack makes contact, causing him to straighten his legs and rise upward, breaking through the ceiling with a pained expression.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A bathroom with pale blue tiled walls and white porcelain fixtures features a claw-foot bathtub with shower curtain partially drawn on the right side of the frame. Steam rises gently from behind the semi-transparent shower curtain, indicating someone is showering inside. Tom, the blue-gray cat, descends slowly through a jagged hole in the ceiling directly above the bathtub, debris falling alongside him. The camera captures Tom's surprised expression as he lands with a splash in the partially filled bathtub, water splashing outward and soaking a startled homeowner who stands in the shower with shampoo in his hair, his annoyed face visible as the curtain partially swings open.

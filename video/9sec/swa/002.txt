The living room features a uniformly painted beige wall and polished wooden floor. A round wooden table sits in the center of the room, illuminated by natural light from a nearby window. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands beside the table with his paws carefully balancing a decorative blue vase that wobbles precariously on the tabletop. The camera shows Tom's concentrated expression as he attempts to stabilize the vase with his paw, his body leaning slightly forward while the vase tilts from side to side.

The living room features a uniformly painted beige wall and polished wooden floor. A round wooden table sits in the center of the room, illuminated by natural light from a nearby window. Tom, the blue-gray cat, watches as the blue vase finally topples over, revealing Jerry, the brown mouse, sleeping peacefully on a small green cushion underneath. The camera follows the vase as it falls and knocks the cushion with Jerry on it, propelling them both toward the open window with Jerry remaining asleep throughout the motion.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The garden outside features a neatly trimmed green lawn, colorful flower beds, and a stone birdbath filled with clear water at the center. Jerry, the brown mouse, still fast asleep on his green cushion, gracefully lands in the water-filled birdbath with a gentle splash. The camera pans slightly to include Tom, the blue-gray cat, who watches from the window with his jaw dropped and eyes widened in disbelief as Jerry continues sleeping peacefully in his new aquatic bed.
